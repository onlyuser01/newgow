<p>Top gaming equipment Everi Holdings and WinStar World Casino and Resort announced Wednesday the launch of WinStar Wallet on December 3.</p>
<p>Partnership with One of The World’s Largest Casinos</p>
<p>Everi Holdings and the Chickasaw Nation’s WinStar World Casino and Resort announced Wednesday that they will launch the WinStar Wallet, a cashless and touchless payment solution, on December 3.</p>
<p>Located an hour north of Dallas, Oklahoma, WinStar World will become the first gaming property to use the digital wallet platform provided by the casino equipment and technology leader. Powered by Everi’s CashClub Wallet, WinStar Wallet will allow cashless payments for food and drinks, golf, and retail outlets, in addition to the casino’s electronic games.</p>
<p>WinStar World is one of the world’s largest casinos with 8,500 slots, 100 table games, and a large array of bars and restaurants. The Chickasaw Nation also owns a competitive golf court right next to the resort. According to Las Vegas-based Everi, partnering with the resort casino to launch the digital wallet will provide the company with a great amount of usage data.</p>
<p>Wager Limits for Responsible Gambling</p>
<p>WinStar patrons can access and use their funds in-game, as well as deposit money on their digital wallet through the mobile app via various means, such as a checking account or a bank card. The app also allows players to send their funds directly back to their bank account.</p>
<p>Darren Simmons, Executive Vice President at Everi Holdings, said that the new digital wallet “provides gaming patrons with the same ability, comfort, and convenience to load, retrieve and unload funds that they experience with other non-gaming digital wallet applications.”</p>
<p>The gaming and financial technology provider launched its first cashless solutions in 2017 via a ticket product, and declared that its brand new mobile wallet will allow players to move their funds online across sports betting or retail casinos. Everi said customers will be able to limit the money wagered through the app, in support of responsible gambling.</p>
<p>“Creating a digital, cashless customer experience has been a focus of ours for some time and throughout our review of various solutions, it was clear Everi’s wallet met all of our goals, Jack Parkinson, General Manager at WinStar World</p>
<p>Everi’s shares on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 4.01% and closed at $11.40 on December 2.</p>
<p>AGA Advocates For Cashless and Touchless Payement</p>
<p>Cashless and touchless payments have been advised by the American Gaming Association (AGA) since last year, in an attempt to modernize the gaming industry. However, the Covid-19 pandemic pushed towards changes in favor of new payment technologies over the past year. Many tribal casinos, such as Florida’s Seminole Hard Rock and San Manuel in Southern California, already made the transition and began using digital payment solutions.</p>
<p>Nevada and Pennsylvania gaming authorities recently approved new regulations allowing digital payments at their casinos. Indiana, Iowa, and New Jersey are expected to do likewise.</p>
<p>Early next year, the Morongo Casino and Resort in Southern California will unveil a new cashless gaming product to provide players with casino markers. The wagering product is not a mobile wallet as the funds will be deposited through the casino.</p>
