<p>The New York Giants vs. Philadelphia Eagles is a 2023 NFL Christmas Day Game, which is taking place on Monday afternoon at Lincoln Financial Field in Philly</p>
<p>There are three games of the 2023 NFL on the program on Christmas Day. We’ve already covered the Las Vegas Raiders vs. Kansas City Chiefs and the Baltimore Ravens vs. San Francisco 49ers games. Now, it’s time to do a Giants vs. Eagles prediction.</p>
<p>You may not think that this game is as interesting as the other two Christmas games, but from a bettor’s perspective, this duel is fantastic. The Giants are 12-point underdogs, which makes them the biggest underdogs of all the teams in Week 16. It’s a big spread, can the Eagles cover it? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>New York Giants Don’t Have Much to Hope For</p>
<p>Sure, there’s a theoretical chance that the New York Giants might make the playoffs, but that chance is extremely low. The thing is that they’re 5-9, meaning that they’ve got no chance of winning the NFC East.</p>
<p>They could challenge for a wild card entry to the postseason, but there for that, they’d need to win all of their remaining games, as well as see some of their rivals fail against big underdogs.</p>
<p>Coach Brian Daboll and his men are aware of this, which is why they probably don’t have big plans for the Christmas game. Instead, they’re coming to Philly to have fun and perhaps try out some moves and strategies that could be useful for them in the next season.</p>
<p>Being the worst offense in the conference with just 13.5 points scored per game, they might decide to risk more when attacking. Rookie quarterback Tommy DeVito might get the freedom to try longer passes rather than just trying to get the Giants to a field-goal distance.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Eagles Need a Big Win to Up Their Confidence</p>
<p>The Eagles are 10-4 in the 2023-24 NFL, with three of their four losses happening in the last three games. To be fair to them, in two of those, they played against real heavyweights – the San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys.</p>
<p>However, in their most recent game, the Eagles lost to the Seattle Seahawks, who were 5-point underdogs before the game. Philly lost 20-17, but they’re the only ones to blame. They could’ve done better defensively – they conceded a touchdown in the final drive of the game.</p>
<p>They also could’ve done better offensively. Their running game was alright, particularly the one of their quarterback Jalen Hurts who scored two rushing TDs that day. Their passing game, however, was disappointing.</p>
<p>Even though A. J. Brown and DeVonta Smith made five receptions each, gaining 50+ yards each, neither of them managed to record a touchdown. The reason why this should worry them is that that was the second game in a row that they failed to score a passing TD. Another reason for concern is that pass defense is actually one of the few things the Giants have been doing well in 2023.</p>
<p>New York Giants vs. Philadelphia Eagles Prediction</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Eagles will win this game, we have no doubt about that. However, we don’t think they’re going to cover the 12-point spread. The Giants will come into this game stress-free, which could make them more creative, the result of which is that we might see them score a couple of TDs on Christmas.</p>
<p>Picks: New York Giants +12.0 &amp; Over 42.5 Points</p>
