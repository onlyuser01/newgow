<p>Frozen Gems review</p>
<p>Frozen Gems is themed around an icy world filled with colorful jewels.</p>
<p>Players will be transported to a chilly realm where they’ll discover countless precious stones. If they can brave the cold, they might just snag a few of these magical gems.</p>
<p>This slot is well suited to players who enjoy gem-themed slots and those in the mood for a fairytale vibe. Fans of the Disney Frozen films may especially appreciate the aesthetic.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The calming soundtrack is filled with delicate notes, adding to the ethereal feel of this slot.</p>
<p>The reels are framed with sculpted leaves and ice. Among the symbols, players will see exquisitely cut rubies, citrine, and amethysts. Each stone is presented against a backdrop of ornately carved ice, upholding their royal look.</p>
<p>The high-quality of the animation creates a strong sense of place, and this draws the player into the enchanted setting. It’s easy to imagine going on a quest for treasure in this world.</p>
<p>Beyond the reels, there is a mysterious snowy landscape with glowing gems scattered around alluringly.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack create a freezing world of magic.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Frozen Gems has five reels, with the size and number of symbols that appear in each reel varying for every spin.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel. This results in 243 ways to win, however, the Splitting Scatters increase the ways to win to 8,748.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter symbol. Bonus Wilds have the ability to transform all symbols into Wilds.</p>
<p>Splitting Scatters divide every symbol into 2 or 3. This increases the number of potential wins. Wilds are included in this feature, but Scatters are not.</p>
<p>A combination of either 2x Splitting Scatters, and one of either two Bonus Wilds and one 3x Splitting Scatters, or one Bonus Wild and two 3x Splitting Scatters will appear for each spin. These symbols will be placed randomly on the reels.</p>
<p>Every Bonus symbol begins as frozen and requires three winning symbols or Scatters on the reel to be thawed and trigger special features on that reel.</p>
<p>The Frozen Spins feature begins when players land 3 Scatters, starting with 9 free spins. Additional Scatters increase the spin count by +1.</p>
<p>Multipliers are carried into the Free Spins feature and are progressively built throughout the feature.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of Frozen Gems is 96.36%, above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of Frozen Gems is medium-high, which makes it a moderate match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, medium-high volatility gem-themed slot.</p>
<p>Gorgeous animation makes Frozen Gems immediately appealing, but the combination of solid RTP and decent volatility also make it a reasonable choice for mathematically-minded players.</p>
