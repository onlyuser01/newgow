    <h1>Spotlight 29 Casino 29 Palms Casino Casino In Nashville Krypto Loco Casino Eureka Casino Resort Mesq</h1>

<p>I know the process; however, I do appreciate your leaving the links just in case needed them. That said, since this happened, I've done a lot of research regarding, BetUS. They aren't really watched at all. They call their home Costa Rica however, Canada is where their base is, in my opinion of course. This actually happened to my husband while he was playing, and I was sitting next to him. Corney as it sounds, we do that, lol. But. I took screen shots of what happened immediately, then another just because I thought I might need it. Anyway, it's so inappropriate how they went about handling this. They must have given me 5 or 6 different reasons why it happened, and my evidence proved them wrong. Last one was something about the software manufacture having looked at it blah blah. I do not believe that for a second. I filed a complaint with you guys' awhile back about Ducky luck casino and eventually, I got paid however, since the payout, which was only 2k. They labeled me as a SKILLED PLAYER, LOL. Which is ridiculous period. They took away all promotions, I'm not given the free spins that everyone else's gets when they deposit. So, I obviously stopped playing there. The other day My husband had deposited probably $100 and lost that, got his free spins and made a little money. Their rollover requirements are insane, but he actually did it. He played for about 2 days until I made him just stop. Anyway, during his play which was his money since he had met the rollover requirements. He was playing the 10x machine. well, they obviously wanted him gone. Every time he would place a large wager his money would drop really fast but, when he dropped it to 30cents it started hitting, not a lot but still his odds had gone up. He just happens to be paying attention, the wagering issue had him alert. So, all of a sudden, he hits 10x blue 7's which according to their pay table, which makes no sense, it paid 20 bucks. He hits it again, same but with some bars? a tiny bit more. Meanwhile I'm taking screen shots of all these wins however, then he hits 10x 10x blue 7s and it pays him $20. What? Then he hits 10x red 7s @45cents paid $60? 15 cents more? Hold on.....then he hits 10x 10x red 7s @ 30cents, paid him $40? I'm more than confused. Weve sent all the screen shots in and they said they have everything. Waiting to hear back. Geeze., the last thing I want to be doing on a beautiful is calling out casinos for ripping us off. Not my idea of a good time. I hate it in fact. I'm just letting you know what's all the rant was about regarding BetUs. I know this site very well. Trust me. They have taken our money many times, however. We chalked it up to our failure to just not play there or do this. This entire industry has fallen to depths I'm ashamed to speak about. I know what you do at Guru, I also know he supports BetUS. Which was a bit shocking to me but to each his own. Thats why m hesitant to even waste my time filing a complaint. When I'm ready I'm probably going to have to spend a little money to have them investigated properly. Because, as of right now, Caraco is their regulator, lol that's funny. But I'll get back to you. in the meantime, we can just chat back n forth regarding this if you like. if not that's fine too. I'm 62 and just tired of the BS. Just be fair. Tired of paying mortgages frankly. Have a nice day.</p>
