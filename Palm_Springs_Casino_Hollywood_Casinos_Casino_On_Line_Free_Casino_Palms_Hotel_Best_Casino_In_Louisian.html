<p>Bookmakers are willing to make everything a bet and such is the case with the next US elections. The odds of Joe Biden re-winning the 2024 elections have become longer, even though Biden is just over a year into his presidency.</p>
<p>There’s a New Betting Favorite for the 2024 Elections</p>
<p>In October, the former president Donald Trump surpassed Biden as the favorite to win the next elections. At the moment, UK-based Ladbrokes puts Biden as the second choice to win the 2024 elections as his odds are currently sitting at +400 (4/1). Additionally, his odds at electionbettingodds.com, which is a live odds aggregator for betfair.com, FTX.com, Smarkets.com, and PredictIt.org, are +545. This comes as a result of Biden’s approval ratings falling down to 40.9%.</p>
<p>Dave Mason, BetOnline sportsbook manager, stated that Biden’s odds are the highest at this stage of his presidency than any other president since the sportsbook started covering politics. At BetOnline, Trump’s odds are currently +250 as he is the favorite to win them. Furthermore, his odds at Ladbrokes are +260, +261 at electionbettingodds.com, and +300 (3/1) at Betfair.</p>
<p>Republicans are also favorites to gain control of the House of Representatives and according to BetOnline, they are favorites to win Democrats’ Senate seats in Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia.</p>
<p>President Biden Is Struggling in Florida as Well</p>
<p>Florida is considered a politically pivotal state and according to a recent Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll state that only 39% of the respondents approve Biden’s work, while 53% disapprove.</p>
<p>Additionally, the poll also states that Biden wouldn’t even win the inter-party presidential nominee elections. He’s trailing behind Hillary Clinton with a 46%-43% within-the-margin-of-error tally. As the numbers of the poll suggest, it is almost certain that Biden will lose in Florida to a nominee from the Republican party, whether that is Governor Ron DeSantis or Trump.</p>
<p>The Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll also suggests that if Trump and DeSantis end up running against each other as Republican presidential nominees, the race in Florida would be extremely close. At the moment, Trump has a 47%-40% lead against DeSantis, within the 7.4% margin of error.</p>
<p>Currently, Gov. DeSantis is the center of attention in Florida as he is navigating through the troubling gaming compact. The compact, led by the Seminole Tribe, has faced many obstacles and was pushed back a few times as many believe that it is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>In November, the federal approval by the Department of the Interior was nullified by a District Court and the Seminole was forced to stop its online sports betting activities. The DoI Secretary, Deb Haaland, has decided to fight against this decision at the end of January.</p>
