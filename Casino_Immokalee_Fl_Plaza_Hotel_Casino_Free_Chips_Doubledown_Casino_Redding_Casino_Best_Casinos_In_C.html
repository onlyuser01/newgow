<p>NeoPollard demands that the DOJ removes iLottery vendors from the ambit of the Wire Act</p>
<p>No definitive law exempts vendors from fault, the company argues</p>
<p>DOJ needs to specify its stance on iLotteries and the Wire Act Opinion</p>
<p>NeoPollard has directed criticism against the Department of Justice (DOJ) over the uncertainty now marring business prospects. With the DOJ still refusing to state how the Wire Act would affect businesses directly, more operators seem prepared to fight back.</p>
<p>New Hampshire’s Lottery Supplier Strikes Back at DOJ</p>
<p>NeoPollard, the New Hampshire iLottery’s supplier has requested from the DOJ to clarify how the latest interpretation of the Wire Act would affect businesses. The DOJ originally planned on enforcing all changes in April, but this timeline has been pushed back for mid-July.</p>

<p>With no clear statement on how the 1961 legislation will affect lotteries and their vendors, business is getting anxious. There have been hints that the DOJ intends to do nothing regarding lotteries and focus on different verticals, such as poker and casino.</p>
<p>New Hampshire Lottery has filed suit re: Wire Act. This had been rumored for a while and many legal experts believe that NH is the optimal plaintiff because of their jurisdiction in the First Circuit Court of Appeals which has already ruled on the limited scope of the Wire Act. — Poker Alliance (@ppapoker) February 15, 2019</p>
<p>The new Opinion was passed in January 15, 2019 with the blanket terms stating that all forms o betting and gambling online would be affected in the sense they were no longer permissible. An initial grace period of 90 days, which is now extended until July, was introduced.</p>
<p>New Hampshire filed a lawsuit on February 19, 2019, challenging the new Wire Act Opinion. Mounting opposition then prompted DOJ to explain that revised opinion does not necessarily have to do with interstate lotteries.</p>
<p>The Charades Must End</p>
<p>NeoPollard is well aware of the potential dangerous that interpreting the Wire Act the wrong way could bring business and executives, including lengthy prison terms as well as stiff financial penalties.</p>
<p>Therefore the vendor requires from DOJ to come up with a clear ruling over whether the Wire Act will seek culpability from vendors and what steps need to be taken to avoid breaking the law. In the official complaint addressed to United States Attorney General William Barr, NeoPollard said:</p>
<p>This charade must end. The Wire Act is a criminal stature and imposes severe penalties – including lengthy terms of imprisonment – on violators. Violations of the Act can serve as predicates for criminal prosecution under the Racketeer Influenced and Corruption Act.</p>
<p>Further down the filing, the NeoPollard lawyers argued that there were presently no laws removing vendors from the ambit of the Wire Act.</p>
<p>As per NeoPollard’s demand is that the Wire Act exempts iLotteries and vendors in particular and pertain only to the original remit of the legislation, i.e. sports betting and gambling.</p>
