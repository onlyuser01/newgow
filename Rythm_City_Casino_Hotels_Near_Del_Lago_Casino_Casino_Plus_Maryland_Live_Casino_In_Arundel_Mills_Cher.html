    <h1>Rythm City Casino Hotels Near Del Lago Casino Casino Plus Maryland Live Casino In Arundel Mills Cher</h1>

<p>The Canadian Football League (CFL) has decided to capitalize on its data and unique position in sports by teaming up with its latest Official Sportsbook Partner</p>
<p>Moving forward, FanDuel will be recognized as the CFL’s newest sportsbook partner, following a similar deal with BetRegal in 2021. The BetRegal collaboration was mostly a successful one, but with the operator still not having secured a license in Ontario, the CFL has decided to look for a better-established operator, which is where FanDuel comes in.</p>
<p>First Authorized Gaming Partner for the CFL</p>
<p>FanDuel has reminded that players who are 19 or older would be able to bet on the CFL through its shopping windows as they see fit. FanDuel offers a variety of bets on the event, including moneylines, totals, spreads, props, and more, making for an exciting variety of available options to wager on.</p>
<p>In fact, FanDuel has become the league’s “first authorities gaming operator” according to an official statement confirmed by the CFL. FanDuel and CFL also make great partners, because FanDuel already has a partnership with TSN, the broadcaster for the league’s games, creating unique synergies and opportunities to leverage data and experiences with fans for greater business momentum. Commenting on this new opportunity, FanDuel Canada general manager Dale Hooper said:</p>
<p>We look forward to working with the CFL and TSN to continue to drive interest in this great league and the next generation of stars by contributing insights that add another element to the great storytelling that is taking place. FanDuel Canada general manager Dale Hooper</p>
<p>Apart from those synergies, the partners will also work on ensuring that people who engage with sports betting do so in a responsible and sustainable way. Responsible gaming is the very first priority, FanDuel’s Hooper confirmed.</p>
<p>Responsible and Sustainable Gambling First</p>
<p>The partnership with the CFL does not come as a surprise either, as the topflight football league has been one of the staunchest supporters of the idea of legalizing sports gambling. When the issue was still debated, the CFL reiterated on numerous occasions the good that would come from regulating the industry.</p>
<p>Of course, the CFL has been well aware of the pitfalls that mass sports betting legalization could invite, and this is why the organizaiton has teamed up with Genius Sports earlier this year to enhance the sport’s integrity. CFL CCO Tyler Mazereeuw was similarly excited at the prospect of ensuring that fans have access to some of the best wagering experiences that are conducted in a safer and more responsible way.</p>
