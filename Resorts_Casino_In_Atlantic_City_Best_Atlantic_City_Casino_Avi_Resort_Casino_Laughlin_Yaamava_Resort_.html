    <h1>Resorts Casino In Atlantic City Best Atlantic City Casino Avi Resort Casino Laughlin Yaamava Resort</h1>

<p>KamaGames had huge plans for 2020 and while the ongoing coronavirus pandemic seems to have slowed down some of those plans, the game developer is still pursuing some of these plans. The plans in question involved several strategic and lucrative partnerships which is part of its bid to extend its footprint across the globe. Thankfully, it has followed through with one of these partnerships and the culmination of the move will certainly be appreciated by many gamers across the world.</p>
<p>The partnership that KamaGames has recently inked is with renowned casino and hospitality operator Hard Rock International. After announcing their new partnership, the two companies also unveiled a new social casino app. The app is now available for both iOS and Android users.</p>
<p>This new app is known as Hard Rock Blackjack and it is certainly a breath of fresh air for online gamers who are looking for something to pass time as they stay indoors amid the efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“Using our expertise, which has been honed over many years in the social casino industry, we are confident that we have created a product that will offer true entertainment value for Hard Rock International customers.” Andrey Kuznetsov, KamaGames CEO</p>
<p>Needless to say, in addition to being a great way of helping gamers keep busy during these difficult times, the move is also a monumental growth opportunity for the company and its partners. Even Hard Rock has the chance to better its online offering.</p>
<p>What to Expect</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Hard Rock Blackjack is a social poker app which means that even though players can buy chips with real money, they will only be able to bet using play money. Buying these chips with real money is optional since the app will give the players free chips when they sign up. Moreover, the users will also have chances to earn free chips on a daily basis with more to come to them when they accomplish various achievements on the app.</p>
<p>Available on Hard Rock Blackjack will be several top-notch 3D variants of casino games like roulette, craps, video poker, slots, and blackjack. It goes without saying that all these casino-style games are staple offerings at both retail and online gambling platforms which means that a lot of people are going to play them.</p>
<p>Emphasis on the Poker Product</p>
<p>All of the games included on the app are definitely great but the Hard Rock Blackjack seems to be laying special emphasis on its very comprehensive social poker product. This is based on KamaGame’s Pokerist Texas Poker model which is very popular among poker lovers all around the world. It will be further complemented by such amazing poker titles as Split Bet Poker and Set Poker.</p>
<p>To top it all off, the players will also be able to enjoy indulging in some competitive poker action via all of the tournaments that will be available on the social casino app.</p>
