    <h1>Southland Casino Buffet Casino Wallpaper Resort And Casino Pechanga Resort Casino Location Casinos I</h1>

<p>Yes, I was fully verified and the casino did not speak or offer any alternative methods, I had to think for myself!</p>
<p>I made a few deposits via Skrill, after which I applied for a withdrawal, they confirmed that the withdrawal would be made on 02/13/2023, but on 02/11/2023 I canceled the payment, and played a little more and won some more money and on 02/12/2023 I applied for a withdrawal again , now again I expect payment of 200 and 300 euros!</p>
<p>In the yard of the 21st century and payments are made almost everywhere instantly, of course, if the casino does not want to keep your funds by all means !! as the casino says that they have a very busy financial department, so you have to wait a long time, I very much doubt that they have 1000 transactions per day that they can't process all payouts, that's complete nonsense!</p>
<p>The support service is some kind of bot that answers with template answers and refers to the email of the financial department, which in turn does not answer either! The support service in the chat simply stopped answering my specific questions and ignoring me!</p>
<p>This casino is a real hell for players, no respect, no comfort, I’m already silent about the return of slots that slow down during the game periodically and play very strangely, and it doesn’t matter which provider, I note that the Internet connection is stable!</p>
<p>I note that many players of this casino faced similar problems, the casino conducts an irresponsible policy towards players, I’m not at all sure that they even paid someone!</p>
<p>In fact, any casino is an intermediary between the player and the provider of casino games, the task of the casino is to provide services to the client and make his time comfortable on their site, and if there are problems with the payment, this indicates that the casino deliberately withholds funds so that the player cancels the withdrawal and that's it lost, or not to pay at all, but to look for reasons for not paying these funds, making requests for new and new documents or coming up with new reasons for not paying! and alas, such as this casino is 80% or even 90%</p>
