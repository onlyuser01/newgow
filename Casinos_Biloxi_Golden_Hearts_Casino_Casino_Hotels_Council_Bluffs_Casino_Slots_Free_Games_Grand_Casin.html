<p>The new title provides players with many chances to win</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play, a leader in the provision of iGaming content, has released a glitzy and glamorous new live casino title called Vegas Ball Bonanza. The dazzling new live show will impress players with a combination of familiar mechanics and innovative twists.</p>
<p>In a game of Vegas Ball Bonanza, players are asked to select a ticket. Each one features a 3×3 grid and contains a total of nine numbers. To win, players must match randomly-drawn balls with the numbers on their tickets.</p>
<p>Combinations of matching numbers will create horizontal and vertical paylines, allowing players to win up to four lines per round. A full house pattern will yield players 250 times their bet.</p>
<p>In addition to that, players can also win big prizes thanks to Bonus multipliers that can help them make the most out of their bets. The multipliers are assigned to random numbers on players’ tickets.</p>
<p>Vegas Ball Bonanza also features two bonus balls that can completely overturn the tides. The so-called Star Ball will activate all bonus multipliers simultaneously when drawn. The Wild Ball, on the other hand, will trigger additional balls, extending the round and providing players with more chances to win.</p>
<p>Overall, Vegas Ball Bonanza features many exciting new mechanics. The new release is easy to understand yet dynamic and engaging, allowing gamblers to make unforgettable memories. The game is in line with Pragmatic Play’s design philosophy that has seen it release many unprecedented games.</p>
<p>Vegas Ball Bonanza will be a welcome addition to Pragmatic Play’s portfolio of live casino games, which features games such as Sweet Bonanza CandyLand and Auto Mega Roulette.</p>
<p>COO Cornides Praised the New Release</p>
<p>The company’s chief operating officer, Irina Cornides, praised the new release, saying that it perfectly exemplifies her company’s commitment to delivering the most premium entertainment experiences in the live casino sector.</p>
<p>She also said that the new game aligns with the company’s strategy to twist, transform and elevate the live casino vertical.</p>
<p>We’ve taken familiar mechanics and twisted them to suit Live Casino audiences, combining a low barrier to entry with bonus balls alongside thrilling multipliers packaged in a stunning environment designed to engage and retain players. Irina Cornides, COO, Pragmatic Play</p>
