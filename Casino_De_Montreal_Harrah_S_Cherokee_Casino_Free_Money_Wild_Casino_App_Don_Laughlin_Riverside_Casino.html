<p>A fire which broke out Saturday evening in an IT room at Michigan’s Bay Mills Resort &amp; Casino led the tribal gaming venue to temporarily shutter. The soonest it is likely to reopen is reportedly Wednesday.</p>

<p>Key internal systems were damaged. They will not be operational for at least three to five days, the Michigan Upper Peninsula gaming property reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>The fire was first observed at about 7 pm. It was in an information technology room on the main floor. Sprinklers were activated.</p>
<p>Smoke Coming from Ceiling</p>
<p>“I noticed that the fire strobes were blinking in the casino,” Jack Kronemeyer, a casino IT specialist, told WPBN, a local TV station.</p>
<p>So, I went back to my office, and … I started smelling smoke… Then, I looked up at our lights in our office, and there was smoke coming out of the ceiling.”</p>
<p>The fire was largely extinguished by water from the sprinklers, WPBN said. Firefighters soon arrived to extinguish the rest of the fire.</p>
<p>A damage estimate was not immediately available. Casino officials estimated the temporary closing will lead to the loss of thousands of dollars, WPBN said.</p>
<p>Sizable Losses Predicted</p>
<p>Casino officials were hoping this year the venue would have a comeback after the pandemic.</p>
<p>It’s very unfortunate, and there will probably be some sizable losses as a result of this,” Bay Mills Casino Manager Richard LeBlanc told WPBN.</p>
<p>No one was injured from the fire. Some 250 guests or employees were all safely evacuated from the casino.</p>
<p>But technology systems were damaged.</p>
<p>“At this moment in time, the heart of our information technology system has been severely compromised,” a casino Facebook post said. Gaming, internet, phones, credit cards, reservation systems, and ATMs are among the systems not working, the casino said.</p>
<p>“We anticipate that these systems will remain down for the next 3 to 5 days, which will result in the temporary closure of Bay Mills Resort &amp; Casino,” the Facebook post added.</p>
<p>On Saturday night, hotel guests were allowed to stay in the hotel. The Back Bay Grill served drinks and food. Hotel guests who left received a full refund. Reservations for five days from Saturday had to be canceled. The guests will be refunded their money.</p>
<p>Golf Course Open</p>
<p>Adjacent Wild Bluff Golf Course remains open for cash-paying players. Three nearby businesses, Bay Mart Gas Station, Four Seasons Market &amp; Deli, and Northern Light Cannabis Company remain open, too.</p>
<p>The gaming property is located in Brimley, Mich. It is owned and operated by the Bay Mills Indian Community.</p>
