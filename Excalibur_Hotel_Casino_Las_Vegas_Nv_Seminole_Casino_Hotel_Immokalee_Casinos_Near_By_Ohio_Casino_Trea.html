    <h1>Excalibur Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nv Seminole Casino Hotel Immokalee Casinos Near By Ohio Casino Trea</h1>

<p>The developer and supplier of iGaming products, LL Lucky Games AB, has signed a new content partnership with Logrand Entertainment Group, a Mexico-based firm, which operates the popular Strendus.mx casino brand in the country, the pair announced in a press release shared with Casino Guru News.</p>
<p>Thanks to this tie-up, the Swedish game studio will be able to inject its leading software solutions in Strendus.mx and help Logrand Entertainment Group to strengthen its local pull with players by bringing a number of high-quality games on the market.</p>
<p>There will be many such games, as LL Lucky Games has developed promising titles, such as Ruler of Egypt, Mr Alchemister, Weight of the Gun, and many others. The companies have vowed to roll out more exciting games from LL Lucky Games’ portfolio, including Valholl Wild Hammers, Beetle Bailey, and not least, The Treasures of Tizoc.</p>
<p>The integration is happening through Slot Matrix, an aggregation platform that helps operators and studios establish a quick connection and can bring more fresh content to market easier than ever before. LL Lucky Games AB CEO and Co-Founder Mads Jørgensen was pleased with the opportunity to build up the company’s presence in the Latin American market.</p>
<p>Jørgensen said that Lady Luck Games was thrilled to be joining Logrand Entertainment Group and seek to explore more excellent opportunities moving forward, as collaboration would be helpful to both entities.</p>
<p>Logrand Entertainment Group Senior Product Manager Eduardo Pelaez added that the operator was similarly happy to see games by Lady Luck Games join in and help the operator deliver more comprehensive products to customers. This is not the first headline that Lady Luck Games has grabbed this month.</p>
<p>Earlier in November, the company announced that it has built and delivered its first Megaways slot, SpinJoy Society Megaways, which debuted with Novibet in Greece. The studio has also been looking to actively expand its international reach and has signed a distribution agreement with RAW Arena to help it reach more Tier 1 operator across at least 14 regulated markets.</p>
<p>Presently, RAW Arena is licensed to provide content in places such as Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, Italy and more, and works with myriad high-profile players, to name VideoSlots, Kindred, Betsson, MrGreen, ComeOn, PokerStars, and more.</p>
