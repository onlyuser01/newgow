<p>A Great Addition to BF Games’ Growing Portfolio</p>
<p>BF Games’ product owner, Piotr Saluda, shared his excitement about the recently released title. He explained that the high-performing Cash Mesh feature was well received by the online users and that the company is excited to add it to one of its all-time hit series, Burning Slots.</p>
<p>“Our Cash Mesh feature has seen great success and we are excited to incorporate it into one our all-time hit titles, Burning Slots.“ Piotr Saluda, product owner at BF Games</p>
<p>Saluda spoke about the engaging gameplay of the new slot that also features a classic theme and at the same time offers different options for great prizes. Finally, he acknowledged that Burning Slots Cash Mesh is an outstanding game that makes a good addition to the BF Games’ growing portfolio.</p>
<p>The New Game Brings Respins and Jackpot Features</p>
<p>Online players that trigger the Cash Mesh feature in Burning Slots Cash Mesh, can see “any position containing a coin symbol being held and all other positions spinning individually,” explains BF Games.</p>
<p>This bonus mode starts with three spins initially, but if a new symbol lands, that count is reset. This continues until the respins are finished or all positions have a coin that fills them in. In case a player hits 15 coins during this bonus mode, they win a Full House Multiplier, which may award them an x2 multiplier of the total value of the coin symbols.</p>
<p>What’s more, the players can also benefit from jackpots. If a player lands a Jackpot or Bonus symbol while in Cash Mesh bonus mode, they can be awarded a Mini/Minor Bonus or a Major/Grand Jackpot. To further boost the engagement and thrill, the Grand, as well as Major jackpots, grow progressively with each spin, building up potential for huge payouts.</p>
