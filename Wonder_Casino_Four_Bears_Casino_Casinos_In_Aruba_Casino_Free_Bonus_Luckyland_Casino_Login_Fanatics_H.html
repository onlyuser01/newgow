    <h1>Wonder Casino Four Bears Casino Casinos In Aruba Casino Free Bonus Luckyland Casino Login Fanatics H</h1>

<p>The three operators join the ranks of six more, meaning the Responsible Gambling Coalition is now at nine members</p>
<p>The Coalition’s member lineup consisted of Bally’s, BetMGM, DraftKings, Entain, FanDuel, and MGM Resorts International, which are now joined by the latest trio as well. The organization came together in September 2022, introducing 12 responsible gaming principles, which members accept to follow.</p>
<p>3 New Members in the Coalition</p>
<p>Fanatics, Hard Rock Digital, and PointsBet all talked about the importance of responsible gambling for the respective companies, and how joining the Responsible Gambling Coalition bolsters their commitment to the cause. The Coalition also received an RGCheck accreditation from the Ontario-based Responsible Gambling Council (RGC) – an established non-profit, dedicated to problem gambling.</p>
<p>Anthony D’Angelo the senior manager of responsible gaming for Fanatics Betting &amp; Gaming, expressed how proud Fanatics was to be entering the ranks of the Coalition.</p>
<p>We are committed to the 12 responsible gaming principles and providing our fans tools and resources to enjoy our products. Anthony D’Angelo, senior manager of responsible gaming, Fanatics Betting &amp; Gaming</p>
<p>Danny Crook, senior vice president of operations at Hard Rock Digital, and Rachel Kasper, senior vice president of legal and compliance at PointsBet US, echoed the same sentiment in the PR release. All three companies showed their commitment to promoting and implementing safer gambling principles as members of the Responsible Gambling Coalition.</p>
<p>The Continued Sustainability Trend</p>
<p>The 12 principles the Coalition defined serve as a rulebook for what companies strive to achieve. All members are committed to the need for a unified, nationwide responsible gaming toll-free helpline, for example, and the group is partnering with the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) by serving as donors and advisory board members.</p>
<p>PointsBet USA and PointsBet Canada recently won RGC accreditation, so this is a natural continuation of the commitments the operator is making to responsible gambling internationally. RG Check is largely seen as an international benchmark for good responsible gambling practices, and many companies aspire to pass this accreditation program.</p>
<p>Fanatics is also stepping up its game in improving sustainability and following good gaming practices this year. The latest partnership with the Coalition is also a continued trend for the company, as Fanatics inked a deal with IBIA – the International Betting Integrity Association – towards the end of January. IBIA is also highly regarded in the global regulated betting industry.</p>
<p>In other good initiatives, Hard Rock International and WWF renewed their collaboration last week. It’s called Earth Hour. Hard Rock properties “went dark” on March 25 for an hour, bringing back to life Hard Rock’s “Save the Planet” motto. The aim is to raise awareness about climate change, and this particular motto is one of Hard Rock’s four founding mottos.</p>
