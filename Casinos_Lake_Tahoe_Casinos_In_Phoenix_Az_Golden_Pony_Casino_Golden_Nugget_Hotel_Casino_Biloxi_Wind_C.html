<p>Blazing Sevens review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Blazing Sevens takes the one-armed bandit theme to its obvious conclusion. People love the speed and simplicity of old, one win-line fruit-machines, but they also love the multiple win lines that allow for big, multi-line wins.</p>
<p>What is the obvious solution? Well, 1x2 Games’ solution is the "ten game classic themed slot". See the Gameplay section for full details on how this works, but suffice to say this is a nice and simple theme, well executed.</p>
<p>It isn’t called "classic" for nothing.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The graphics are very simple. Ten single-line, three reel slots arranged in neat and shiny rows. The symbols are well rendered with an eye to the fact that the ten game format means each individual game will be rendered incredibly small on the already smaller screen space of browser-based games.</p>
<p>The animations are slick and timed so that the win pattern has some of the same pleasing geometry of an old-style airport departures display board.</p>
<p>Win in the Blazing Sevens slot game</p>
<p>The music and sound effects are off by default. You can turn them on to listen to a repetitive background music which gets annoying quite quickly, but the sound effects do a good job of creating excitement. Unfortunately, you can't choose just one of them, music and sound effects are operated by a single on/off button.</p>
<p>All in all, this is a well-designed slot on the front end.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The ten game aspect of Blazing Sevens is as straightforward as it sounds. Instead of playing one set of reels with one set of symbols you play ten separate reels, each of which spins and pays out individually.</p>
<p>Each game is a one by three game with payouts only occurring if you hit three of the same symbols. In the main game, these range from twice your bet per line for Cherries up to one hundred times your bet per line for three Orange Sevens.</p>
<p>It is a fun version of a simple classic form of gameplay.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>There is only one bonus in Blazing Sevens, although it tests the limits of what a reviewer might count as a bonus as distinct from an aspect of gameplay.</p>
<p>When you hit three matching Sevens, the "Blazing Sevens" mode is triggered for a limited number of spins. You continue to pay a stake for each spin so these are not free spins.</p>
<p>In the Blazing Sevens mode the reels change to much higher volatility win frequencies and payouts. It is only in the Blazing Sevens mode that you have the opportunity to land one of the big 420 times jackpots for three yellow sevens (the highest single line payout in the game).</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Where the base game plays as a very low volatility slot, the Blazing Sevens mode (see the section on Bonuses for details) is very high volatility. How high the overall volatility of the game is will depend on how often you trigger the higher volatility mode. We recommend high volatility slots, especially if you are planning to follow our preferred strategies, so we would probably recommend avoiding this one, given the low volatility of the base game.</p>
<p>The return to player is also only 95.00%, this is rather low and counts as a demerit against Blazing Sevens overall.</p>
<p>Paytable for both base game and the "Blazing Sevens bonus game</p>
<p>The site we tested offered a range of bet sizes from the maximum of £/$/€50.00 per spin (rather low compared to most slots) down to a minimum of £/$/€0.20 per spin (£/$/€0.02 for each individual game of the ten).</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>While sleek to look at and instituting a pleasant format, the low RTP and low volatility mean this is a hard game to recommend.</p>
<p>You may find it works for you if you just love playing fruit machine style slots and want to cram as many spins as possible into your time, but most players are better looking elsewhere.</p>
