<p>Fanatics Sportsbook, the long-anticipated sports betting platform spearheaded by the namesake apparel sportswear brand, has finally cut the red ribbon on its operations, and launched officially into four states.</p>
<p>This rollout follows a pilot test that was meant to test the platform’s capabilities, navigate local regulation, and seek to strike synergies between the apparel business’reach with consumers and sports fans keen to place a wager on the outcome of an event.</p>
<p>It also comes after the acquisition of PointsBet US assets, which saw Fanatics Sportsbook enter a brief bidding war against DraftKings, one of the current leaders in the sports betting market in the United States.</p>
<p>Fanatics Sportsbook is now officially available in Tennessee, Ohio, Maryland, and Massachusetts, and it is also planning to launch into more states. The official release of the company’s platform comes with an extensive six-month period of testing, with the company’s dedicated iOS and Android apps also available in the four states.</p>
<p>Fanatics is bringing a wide array of possible experiences that will feature moneyline bets, spreads, totals, player props, and in-play betting, along with Same Game Parlays, and so much more. Commenting on this rollout, Fanatics Betting and Gaming Chief Product Officer ScotMcClintic said that Fanatics was confident in the launch of its products.</p>
<p>"We are laser-focused on solving pain points facing customers by offering a faster, easier, and a more rewarding sports betting experience. The strategic patience to build a product for the long-term has given us an opportunity to redefine a customer’s expectation of what a sportsbook should be," McClintic explained, arguing that Fanatics was a company that sought to elevate the experience across the board.</p>
<p>There are a number of specific industry aspects that Fanatics Sportsbook has been actively working on over the six months, including an idea to build a "better-rewarding sportsbook" through the use of its FanCash – The Currency of Sport concept, a loyalty program that ties together the Fanatics digital platform.</p>
<p>Another big focus here is to create a more personalized experience across the board, the sportsbook argues, as it looks forward to elbowing out better-established competitors who are equally keen on offering a stronger personal touch.</p>
<p>Fanatics Betting and Gaming also believe that the fact that its parent company has focused on sports for years is another strong hand it has to play in the regulated betting market in the United States. How successful it would be against the likes of ESPN Bet and the rest of the lot remains to be seen.</p>
