<p>With sports slowly returning back to normal, blockchain betting portal Wagerr saw an increase in betting volume between May 11 and May 17. The website has added a string of new competitions and markets to bet on, and not least, the DreamHack Masters Spring 2020.</p>
<p>Latest Wagerr Update Sees Platform Push up Betting Volume</p>
<p>Wagerr has released its latest weekly update covering the period May 11 and May 17, reporting 171 completed events. The betting volume in the week stood at 3,889,066 $WGR, close to $100K in net value. With some $99,797 placed over the week, Wagerr saw an uptick since May 12, when the betting volume registered was $69,875. This weekâ€™s update was even better than the amount registered between April 13 â€“ April 19 when the total betting volume stood at $84,720.</p>
<p>This growth has been occasioned by several factors, not least the returning of German football with Bundesliga 1 &amp; 2, and the addition of Estoniaâ€™s Meistriliiga. Wagerr has been systematically growing its offer, expanding its footprint into new markets, and using the sports lull to build a more comprehensive betting offer.</p>

<p>Boosting Growth by Adding New Markets</p>
<p>Anticipating the return of sports, Wagerr has worked tirelessly to expand its clout and add more viable competitions. Late on Friday, the platform announced the addition of another esports event, with the DreamHack Masters Spring 2020 now available to bet on at Wagerr.</p>
<p>The first events available to bet on are mousesports and BIGCLANgg with the list growing and available on the official website. Meanwhile, we have seen a string of updates in the world of professional sports.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the platform added Czech First League along with the Hungarian Cup or Magyar Kupa. Earlier this week, the platform also expanded its footprint with the addition of professional football in Estonia while the BTC Halving event rivetted most of the bettorsâ€™ attention.</p>
