<p>The Aliante winner was identified as “Deven.” He played a 25-cent Wheel of Fortune slot machine on Valentine’s Day.</p>
<p>Deven, who’s a Boyd Reward member, was playing $1.75 a spin at the Boyd Gaming property.</p>
<p>Also on Valentine’s Day, Caesars Entertainment announced two winners at its Las Vegas properties.</p>
<p>Just an hour before Valentine’s Day began, Linda Fleischmann of California won $128,070. That’s after hitting a progressive jackpot while playing Face Up Pai Gow Poker at Paris Las Vegas. Fleischmann was visiting Las Vegas to spend time with cousins.</p>
<p>She was playing for just an hour on the casino floor when she hit the jackpot. Fleischmann revealed the money will be used to pay for home renovations, as well as for future travel. Fleischmann is a Caesars Rewards member.</p>
<p>Then, at 3:08 a.m. on Tuesday, an unnamed player at Caesars Palace Las Vegas won $219,000. The guest was playing slot machines at the Caesars Entertainment property.</p>
<p>Also, at Caesars Palace, another unnamed player won $155K while playing an Ultimate Poker X video poker machine on Saturday. His winning hand included four aces with a kicker on a multiplier. The win took place at 2:30 a.m. That player was also a Caesars Rewards member.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, at Harrah’s Las Vegas, James Grimes of Fairfield, Ohio, won $124K while playing I Luv Suits poker at the Caesars Entertainment property. He was taking part in a Las Vegas poker tour and had been playing at Harrah’s for only a half hour before hitting a winning, six-card straight flush.</p>
<p>Grimes, who owns a bar in Ohio, says he’ll use the jackpot to pay off debt and will share some of it with his family.</p>
<p>Other Las Vegas Valley Winners</p>
<p>Boulder Station, a Station Casinos property, saw a Dancing Drums slot machine $10K winner on Monday. The player had wagered $1.76.</p>
