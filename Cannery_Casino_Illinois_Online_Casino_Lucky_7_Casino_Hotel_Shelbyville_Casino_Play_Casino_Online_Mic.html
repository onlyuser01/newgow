<p>The search was authorized by a court order and conducted by the Michigan Attorney General’s Office, the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB), the Michigan State Police, the Genesee County Sheriff’s Office, and the Flint Police Department.</p>
<p>According to Henry Williams, the Executive Director of MGCB, storefront casinos and illegal gambling present significant risks to communities, both socially and economically. They can attract criminal activity and divert customers from legitimate businesses that contribute positively to the local economy.</p>
<p>“It essential that these types of operations get shut down to prevent customers from falling prey to fraudulent schemes and protect them from potential harm,” Williams said in a recent public statement.</p>
<p>Both criminal charges and/or fines are possible against the recent operators.</p>
<p>Location’s Raid History</p>
<p>The same location was previously raided on August 18, 2022, under the name “Cellular Vault.” It was then closed and replaced by the Flint Arcade,</p>
<p>In a separate raid last August, the MGCB targeted another Flint storefront operation called the “Cellular Bank,” where 11 standalone slot machines and 13 computers were confiscated. The authorities seized about $7,500 in cash and business records from both Cellular Bank and the Vault.</p>
<p>On April 27, 2022, investigators discovered alleged storefront gaming venues in Michigan known as the State Road Spot in Davison and the Bristol Spot in Burton. They confiscated 100 devices, $29,200 in cash, and various gift cards. Offenders involved may face criminal charges and/or fines</p>
<p>The outlets were identified as the State Road Spot in Davison and the Bristol Spot in Burton.</p>
