<p>Sheep Gone Wild review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Sheep Gone Wild is a farm-yard themed slot developed by Red Tiger Gaming. The slot is based around a sneaky wolf trying to get his hands on some sheep and other farm-yard animals.</p>
<p>Sheep Gone Wild whisks players away to the middle of the countryside, where a playful barnyard scene is about to be disrupted by a fox and a selection of bonus features.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Cartoon-like graphics are common in farm-themed slots, and Red Tiger doesn’t stray too far from the established formula. The game is set in a farmyard, with a wooden banner surrounding the reels.</p>
<p>The characters in the game are the titular sheep, with a selection of other barn-yard animals joining them on the reels. It uses a similar art style to the popular Pragmatic Play slot, The Dog House Multihold.</p>
<p>A sneaky wolf lingers around the reels, but it all feels very playful, with the company opting to avoid the more sinister suggestions of the wolf eating the sheep. There are also some nice animations involved when the bonus features are triggered, with the slot transitioning from day to light smoothly.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Red Tiger keeps things basic for the Sheep Gone Wild slot. The game has five reels, each displaying four symbols. There are 25 active paylines on every spin.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Before each spin, you will want to check your stake. This is controlled by clicking the stake option below the reels. There is also an autospin feature available.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>Keep your eyes peeled for sheep wandering across the screen. You can click one of these and trigger one of two Sheep Snatch modifiers. This can be either a symbol transformation modifier, where all instances of one symbol transform into Wilds, or a multiplier of x2 or x3 being applied to the spin.</p>
<p>Randomly triggered feature - Click the Sheep</p>
<p>Multiple sheep can occur in one spin, and if so, multipliers can be stacked together up to x8.</p>
<p>There are more modifiers available in the Sheep Gone Wild Free Spins bonus. This is triggered when players land three Scatters, with seven spins being rewarded. Before the round starts, players are presented with 15 sheep to choose from, with the number of sheeps you get to choose being determined by the number of Scatters that triggered the round.</p>
<p>Bonuses picking game before Free Spins start playing out</p>
<p>The symbol transformation and multipliers from the Sheep Snatch bonus can be revealed, with multipliers stacking up to x10, or players can get additional spins. If you land a Scatter during the round, you will get the chance to pick another sheep.</p>
<p>Depending on your location, you may also have the option to buy your way into the bonus rounds.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>Sheep Gone Wild might look like a soft and cuddly little outing, but it manages to pack a punch in the winning department. The game has a maximum win of 13,409x the player’s stake, which is a generous amount that will grab some attention.</p>
<p>Full paytable for the Sheep Gone Wild slot</p>
<p>The slot is also considered highly volatile by Red Tiger, which is something we always recommend looking for in our slot strategy guide. The RTP is slightly below average at 95.72%.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Farm-based slots can be a lot of fun, and Sheep Gone Wild is another good example of this. The slot’s quirky design is likely to please fans of the genre, and there is plenty to smile about when it comes to the gameplay and winning potential.</p>
<p>The 13,409x winning potential is one of the biggest selling points of the game and shows that this slot has a lot more bite than its soft exterior might suggest. Overall, this is a solid effort from the ever-dependable Red Tiger Gaming.</p>
