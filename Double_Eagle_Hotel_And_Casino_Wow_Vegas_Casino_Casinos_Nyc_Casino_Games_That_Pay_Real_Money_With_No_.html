    <h1>Double Eagle Hotel And Casino Wow Vegas Casino Casinos Nyc Casino Games That Pay Real Money With No</h1>

<p>The upcoming edition of SBC Summit Barcelona will reunite hundreds of player safety professionals this year who will come together to discuss the state of the industry and what measures can be done to improve gambling harm prevention. Overall, the industry has made a huge leap forward toward bolstering player protection, but there is still room for improvement.</p>
<p>Companies who have dedicated their entire professional lives to building a safer gambling industry for consumers will all be in attendance, including Casino Guru’s Sustainable and Safer Gambling Lead Šimon Vincze who is helping spearhead the Global Self-Exclusion Initiative, an ambitious project designed to show operators the value of improving their protection of consumers by creating a new generation of self-exclusion solutions.</p>
<p>The event’s problem gambling angle will reunite a number of prominent companies, such as Gamban, GamCare, Gordon Moody, Epic Risk Management, YGAM, DealMeOut, Mindway, Betknowmore, FEJAR, and others. SBC CEO &amp; Founder Rasmus Sojmark welcomed the opportunity for SBC to do more to help bolster the industry’s best-in-class practices.</p>
<p>"We have built a separate 'Player Protection Stage' to host discussions on the ever-important issue of problem gambling. The industry needs to remain vigilant in educating itself on harm prevention strategies, especially given the highly fragmented ecosystem we're experiencing," Sojmark added.</p>
<p>The "Player Protection Stage" will reunite all stakeholders interested in this segment and the aforementioned companies which will together outline a path to the future in which protecting vulnerable customers plays a pivotal role.</p>
<p>Other prominent stakeholders who will be attending the expo include Rasmus Kjærgaard from Mindway AI, Alan Feldman from UNLV, Dan Spencer, Director of Safer Gambling at Epic Risk Management, Warren Russell, Founder &amp; CEO at W2, Matthew Hickey, CEO at Gordon Moody, and many other attendees interested in ensuring that players across numerous jurisdictions are protected.</p>
