<p>A Las Vegas gang member was arrested this week for allegedly stealing a safe containing $750,000 in cash and $250,000 in poker chips from the home of pro poker player Chad Power.</p>

<p>The suspect, Brock Brewer, 32, and at least one other man, allegedly followed Power from a Las Vegas casino to his Henderson, Nev. house earlier this year.</p>
<p>The duo returned on Feb. 10, when they allegedly broke into the residence through a back door when nobody was home. They stole the safe before fleeing via a front door, police said.</p>
<p>Power was playing poker at the Las Vegas Strip’s Aria Hotel &amp; Casino when the break-in took place, police told KVVU, a local TV station.</p>
<p>The burglary was captured on a home surveillance camera. Video showed two men breaking into the residence, police said. When they left, one had the safe on his shoulder, police add.</p>
<p>Ties to Prior Vegas Thefts</p>
<p>Soon after the crime, a Henderson detective assigned to the case looked for prior burglaries or robberies which targeted poker players in Southern Nevada.</p>
<p>It was discovered that in 2006, an unnamed poker player was followed from the Bellagio back to his house. That’s where $15,000 in cash and chips were stolen, KVVU said. Brewer was a suspect in that case, police said.</p>
<p>An earlier photo of Brewer was similar to the man shown in the video taken at Power’s home. A check of cellphone records showed Brewer was at the house when the duo stole the safe, police said.</p>
<p>Following their investigation, Henderson police booked Brewer Tuesday at the Clark County Detention Center. He was charged with theft of $100,000 or greater, conspiracy, and home invasion, the Review-Journal said.</p>
<p>Brewer remained in custody at the jail as of Thursday morning, according to correctional center records. He is scheduled to appear in Henderson Justice Court on June 1.</p>
<p>Belongs to New Born Crips Gang, Cops Said</p>
<p>Brewer is a known gang member, according to the Review-Journal. Police reveal he is a member of the New Born Crips gang. It is also known as “NBC.” His gang moniker is “C-Rida.”</p>
<p>Previously, Brewer was convicted for attempted battery with substantial bodily harm, conspiracy, and robbery, police told the Review-Journal.</p>
<p>Brewer lives in the security-gated Rhodes Ranch neighborhood of Las Vegas. Police recently spotted Brewer driving a 2021 Dodge Charger Hellcat there.</p>
<p>The vehicle’s listed owner was Brewer’s mother, according to police. It was purchased on Feb. 15 through a $30,000 cash down-payment at a Claremont, Calif. dealer. Also located at Brewer’s residence was a 2018 Maserati Levante SUV. It also is registered to Brewer’s mother. It was purchased in Arizona for $60,000 in cash, police said.</p>
<p>Police seized both vehicles. Officers believe at least these two vehicles were purchased by using the stolen cash. A third vehicle at Brewer’s home was also seized by cops.</p>
<p>The currency stolen from the safe was in $100 bills. Most were grouped in collections of $50,000.</p>
<p>Chad Power Ranked Poker Player</p>
<p>Chad Power has earned $610,094 in total live tournament winnings, based on information from the Hendon Mob poker database.</p>
<p>He is ranked 3,533rd on an all-time money list. He lists his residence as Pittsburgh, Pa.</p>
