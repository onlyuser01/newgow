<p>OlyBet, the leading betting brand with significant experience from the Baltic region that is also a part of Olympic Entertainment Group, vowed its support for betting integrity by becoming the latest member of the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA).</p>
<p>IBIA is a globally-recognized organization that is the voice of the licensed betting industry.

Additionally, more than 120 sports betting brands also collaborate with the Association, helping with the monitoring and integrity of different sports events around the globe.</p>
<p>Through collaborative efforts, IBIA members help flag suspicious betting activities and uncover match-fixing attempts. The Association currently has a growing network of partners within the regulatory landscape and the betting vertical, allowing it to leverage data and investigate fraud or manipulation attempts. Such data can also be used by different governing bodies when prosecuting match-fixing or other sports integrity threats.</p>
