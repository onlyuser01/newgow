<p>Toshi Video Club review</p>
<p>Players will be transported to a retro Japanese world of Toshi Video Club.</p>
<p>In this vintage graphic novel-style realm, adorable characters and plenty of ‘90s imagery await. With a little luck, players will learn the secrets of this quirky setting.</p>
<p>Toshi Video Club is a great pick for fans of Japanese culture and those searching for a unique aesthetic.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Players will be immediately struck by Toshi Video Club’s limited color choice of beige, black, gray, and orange. This contributes to the faded, vintage aesthetic that makes this slot immediately novel. When a dash of turquoise green appears, it stands out sharply and gives its symbol emphasis.</p>
<p>Sharp-eyed players will notice that Ben Day dots are used to give the graphics an old-fashioned graphic novel or newspaper ink look. It feels as if the reels might leave a trace of ink on players’ fingers if touched.</p>
<p>Among the symbols, players will find neatly designed sushi rolls, running bears, whales, and televisions. A smiling frog stands out with vivid orange rays surrounding him and an enigmatic smile.</p>
<p>Beyond the reels, a faintly drawn Japanese city street can be seen, adding further to the nostalgic feel of this slot.</p>
<p>The haunting soundtrack is accented with delicate chimes that nod to the slot’s Eastern inspiration. A tense, underlying beat gives the music a dark tone and makes it clear that there’s more than whimsy in this world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Toshi Video Club is a five-reel, five-row slot with 15 win lines.</p>
<p>The game has a maximum payout of 10,000x the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>The gameplay is smooth and timely, ensuring it will be easy for players to stay engaged.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>If the Daruma symbol appears on the reels with a winning combination of symbols, it shows a value that is then either added to the win or used as a multiplier.</p>
<p>The Daruma symbols come in three sizes:</p>
<p>Small Daruma: show multipliers from 1x to 5x</p>
<p>Medium Dauma: show multipliers from 10x to 20x</p>
<p>Big Daruma: show multipliers from 25x to 100x</p>
<p>There are also Green Daruma symbols and these offer multipliers from 2x to 5x.</p>
<p>Landing 3 Free Spin symbols initiates the Free Spins feature. Players begin with 10 free spins and progressive multipliers are active during the feature. After every spin, the multiplier shown is applied to any winnings.</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Free Spins symbol.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
