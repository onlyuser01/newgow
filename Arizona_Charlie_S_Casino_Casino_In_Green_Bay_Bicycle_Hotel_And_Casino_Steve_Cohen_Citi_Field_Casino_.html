    <h1>Arizona Charlie S Casino Casino In Green Bay Bicycle Hotel And Casino Steve Cohen Citi Field Casino</h1>

<p>Supplier of gaming technology and solutions to the global gaming industry Aspire Global revealed today the first brand which adopted its player account management (PAM) system, Bettarget.com, registered steady turnover growth and spike across all main key performance indicators (KPIs).</p>
<p>BtoBet’s Sportsbook Generates Value</p>
<p>Australia-based tech supplier Aspire Global and Bettarget.com, a sports betting operator focused on the UK and Irish markets, signed a deal in August for the integration of BtoBet’s sportsbook to power the sports betting offering of the operator. Now, three months later, the deal is already justified, BtoBet’s parent Aspire Global announced.</p>
<p>As the first brand to rely on Aspire Global’s PAM with BtoBet’s sports betting solution, Bettarget.com registered a relative 200% increase in revenue per customer and steady rate of turnover growth, while the business’s main KPI’s are spiking across the board.</p>
<p>Bettarget.com’s incredibly positive results clearly show the capabilities of BtoBet’s sportsbook and our ability to successfully integrate a previously acquired strategic product in our commercial development plans.” Tsachi Maimon, CEO, Aspire Global</p>
<p>The positive effect is also due to BtoBet’s full certification granted by the UK Gambling Commission at the beginning of the year that allowed the tech supplier to offer its “player-centric” sports betting technology and features across the demanding UK market and boosted Bettarget.com’s market offering and product optimization capabilities.</p>
<p>Aspire Global announced that 10 more partners are already using its new proprietary PAM solution and also registering impressive overall business results. Among the latest to hire the services of BtoBet’s sportsbook solution are BestBet24 and FanDuel, which teamed with Aspire Global to power its daily fantasy sport (DFS) offerings in Brazil.</p>
<p>This is yet another significant step in the execution of our effective growth strategy. Having such a successful brand in our repertoire illustrates the potential of our BtoBet solution for Aspire Global with both existing and new customers, particularly in Europe, the US and Latin America.” Tsachi Maimon, CEO, Aspire Global</p>
<p>Enhancements in the Pipeline</p>
<p>Planning for the future and looking to take advantage of this momentum, BtoBet is preparing to introduce a wide range of product enhancements to make sure its B2B partners remain competitive and continue on a growth trajectory, with the introduction of bets on horse racing as the latest expansion of its sports betting service.</p>
<p>Aspire Global acquired the technology supplier that boasts a significant presence across markets in Europe, Latin America and Africa in an all-cash deal in October 2020. Since then continued to expand its operations by signing deals with key operators like Betfair in the UK and William Hill in Colombia, while also acquiring the strategic certification in the UK.</p>
