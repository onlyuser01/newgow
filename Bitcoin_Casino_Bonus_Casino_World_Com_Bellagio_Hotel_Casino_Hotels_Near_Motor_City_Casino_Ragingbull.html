<p>Push Gaming has signed a content partnership with 888casino, a global provider of iGaming products. The partnership will allow Push Gaming to launch an initial selection of its portfolio onto the platform, with the addition of Jammin’ Jars, Jammin’ Jars 2, Razor Shark, Mystery Museum, and Wild Swarm as some of the company’s most popular titles.</p>
<p>Push Gaming will use this opportunity to secure access to new markets that will happen through 888casino’s own jurisdictional reach in various markets and popularity with audiences around the world. The initial foray is targeted on the UK market, which 888casino’s home base of operation.</p>
<p>Bringing Award-Winning Games to Leading Operators</p>
<p>However, Push Gaming and 888 will be expanding further. Push Gaming recently managed to secure a partnership with Betsson, but it has similarly negotiated partnerships with The Rank Group, Casumo, LeoVegas, Entain, and others. Push Gaming has been able to gather momentum over the past two years and establish itself as a leading supplier.</p>
<p>The company won the Casino Beats Game Developer Awards and received further distinctions at the EGR B2B Awards 2021. The current partnership expands on the company’s reception of UK Gambling Commission and Malta Gaming Authority licenses in 2020. The company is now working to advance its products in previously untapped markets that the MGA license covers.</p>
<p>Speaking of the deal, Push Gaming head of sales Fiona Hickey said that the deal is a testament to the quality of products that the company delivers. She added:</p>
<p>“888 is one of the world’s leading online betting and gaming companies, and our partnership presents a fantastic opportunity to build on our recent successes, with our exposure in key markets significantly enhanced.” Push Gaming head of sales Fiona Hickey</p>
<p>Award-Winning Products for 888casino’s Customers</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 888 VP B2C casino Talya Benyamini welcomed the opportunity to be adding new content by what is an established supplier in the iGaming space. She praised Push Gaming’s award-winning titles and argued that 888 is looking forward to introducing them to its audiences:</p>
<p>“Push Gaming’s award-winning titles will add to our existing portfolio of casino games, helping us to deliver on our commitment to offering players an entertaining and varied gaming experience. We look forward to working with Push Gaming in the coming months.” 888 VP B2C casino Talya Benyamini</p>
<p>888 has been working on numerous similar content deals to reinforce its product offering with customers. Last week, 888 added more content from Oryx Gaming. Interest by suppliers in the UK gambling market has not let up even though regulators are planning on introducing stricter overall rules and regulations.</p>
