    <h1>Doubleu Casino Capitol Casino North Carolina Casinos Casino Boats Near Me Casino In Phoenix Az Velve</h1>

<p>So i won a tournament on the 22nd of march and immediately put in for the withdraw request for the full 225.</p>
<p>I then continued to ply with noney i hax deposited earlier in yhe day it was 18 dollars i deposited. I ended up entering another tournament and didn't win anything in it. But the supervisor PAUL is his name.</p>
<p>I finally grt aholdof him onthe 14th of april to ask why my withdraw was delayed? He comes back and telld me that it hasn't and wont be reviewed by the payments team because i never completed the playthrough? I gad no idea there was a playthrough attached to tournament winnings, i didn't know they were allowed to do that?</p>
<p>So anyways i canceled the withdrawal because that is what i was told to do by PAUL. I go and complete the playthrough and resubmitted the withdrawal request.</p>
<p>Then PAUL comes back and tells me that the other two withdrawals that i had pending one was for $410 the other was for 100 both were from tournament winnings that were paid entry tournaments the weekend after the 22nd of march.</p>
<p>The thing is that i know 100% that i had completed the playthrough for the other two but PAUL convinced me otherwise (foolishly i admitt) andnof course i lost those funds.</p>
<p>Then i get ahold of PAUL again on the 8th of may to again ask about the delay on the same 225 withdrawal. And he comes back and try's to tell me the same thing he did on the 14th of april that i haven't completed the playthrough for the 225 again?</p>
<p>This time i refuse to cancel and playthrough it again and resubmit. (I think that is what made him mad ir something). Then he co.es back a little bit later and tells me that my withdraw hasn't been reviewed and it will not be reviewed. This time he says that i used the winnings to enter the orher tournament on The 22nd of march. And that it was a violation to do such.</p>
<p>How can he say that when the withdrawal request was for the entire amount i had won? And then hownwoild that void my winnings? I understand that it could void any winnings after if i had used the funds i had won in the tournament. But that wasn't the case it was my own deposited funds?</p>
<p>Then today i had tried to reach out to the casino manager at least thats what i was told the emails address was for. But it was just PAUL rhat answered again this time he was very rude and told me to cancel the withdraw so he can remove the funds because i will not recieve them? And he didn't say why just that i was already told before?</p>
