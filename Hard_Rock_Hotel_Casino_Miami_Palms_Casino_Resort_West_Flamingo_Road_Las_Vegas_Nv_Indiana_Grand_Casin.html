<p>Glitnor Group, a rapidly-growing gambling operator, unveiled its plans to migrate its head office to a new location in Malta. The European gambling company’s new headquarters will be located in Tigné Point, one of the most sought-after locations in the island nation.</p>
<p>The relocation will see Glitnor Group, the company behind the gambling supplier Swintt and B2C brands such as LyckyCasino and HappyCasino, depart from its current headquarters located in Silema’s Villino Zammit.</p>
<p>Glitnor Group occupied the first Sliema residence in January 2022. However, its recent growth demanded a larger hub for its business, prompting the current switch. According to the group itself, its headquarters in Sliema was no longer big enough to house its growing workforce.</p>
<p>Tigné Point is located on a picturesque peninsula in Sliema and, as noted by the group, is set against a stunning backdrop of historical buildings. While the company will change its headquarters, the core values that have driven it to its current success will remain the same, the group added.</p>
<p>According to Glitnor, its team members will continue to benefit from multiple initiatives that are designed to help them maintain a good work-life balance. These include flexible in-office hours and workspaces that are designed to nurture teamwork.</p>
<p>Glitnor Group remains committed to supporting its employees which is why it is still one of the most sought-after employers in Malta and the iGaming industry as a whole. The comfortable new location further highlights the gambling giant’s care for its team.</p>
<p>The New Location Reflects Glitnor’s Growth</p>
<p>Glitnor Group’s chief people officer, Cathryn McGinty, commented on her company’s decision to move its main office. She said that she is very excited about the change as the new location reflects the company’s recent growth.</p>
<p>McGinty noted that the switch comes in the wake of Richard Brown’s appointment as the company’s new chief executive officer. The transfer to the new location, therefore, further highlights Glitnor’s desire to change and evolve while maintaining its core values.</p>
<p>McGinty said that the new office is perfectly fit for the company as it is now. She concluded:</p>
<p>We’re really looking forward to moving in and hope the team will love the new HQ as much as we do. Cathryn McGinty, chief people officer, Glitnor Group</p>
<p>In other news, Glitnor Group recently found itself in hot water as it got slapped with a $261,000 fine following an investigation by Malta’s Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit.</p>
