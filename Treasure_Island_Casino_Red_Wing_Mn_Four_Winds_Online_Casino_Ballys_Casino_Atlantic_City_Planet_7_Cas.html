<p>SOFTSWISS Jackpot Aggregator, a solution designed to help iGaming brands boost their engagement and amplify their reach with target audiences, has reported that it has been able to sign 50 online casino partners, with the addition of 50Crows fittingly becoming the 50th partner to join the solution.</p>
<p>This partnership will allow the Curacao-licensed FIAT and cryptocurrencycasino to further pursue growth opportunities with its Jackpot Aggregator. Part of this includes the Royal Jackpot campaign designed by SOFTSWISS to engage with casinos and their audiences in a new and exciting way.</p>
<p>The Royal Jackpot Campaign features several prize pools denoted as Minor, Major, and Grand, which allow players to experience their favorite brands with a layer of added fun. Jackpot Aggregator’s present-day successes are doubly-important as the tool was launched only in 2021, and it has been rapidly expanding its reach and offer.</p>
<p>More than 16,000 jackpots have been claimed to date, with SOFTSWISS confident in the success of the product and the way it helps brands better engage with their audiences. The company has called its solution "a true game-changer" and one of the most notable advancements in the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>The arrival of a 50th brand was welcomed by SOFTSWISS Jackpot Aggregator Head AliakseiDouhin who said that this was a significant milestone to celebrate.</p>
<p>"We are proud to announce that we now have 50 brands on board! I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Jackpot Aggregator’s team for their exceptional professionalism and to our esteemed clients for placing their trust in us," Douhin said, touting the interest in the company’s product.</p>
<p>He noted that more than €1bn in total bets have been placed across the different jackpot campaigns run by SOFTSWISS. Douhin also commended partner operators who are part of the Jackpot Aggregator product for not just accepting the solution at face value but also tailoring it and developing advanced campaigns that work better for their particular audiences.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS is still very much involved in the process, the company says. It offers support when it comes to building custom campaigns that are designed to better engage with customers and offer an in-depth analysis of performances and how to better reach out to potentially interested players within the established community.</p>
<p>Recently, SOFTSWISS also launched its Online Casino Budget Calculator, a tool designed to help companies looking to expand into iGaming to calculate the costs of the venture.</p>
