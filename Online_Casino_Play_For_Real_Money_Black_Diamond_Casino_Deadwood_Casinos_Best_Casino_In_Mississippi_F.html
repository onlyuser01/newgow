<p>Similar to the first game Hellcatraz 2 features 8-bit graphics, reminding of the old-school SEGA and Nintendo games. Not unexpectedly, the sound effects match the retro vibe. Just like in the first game from the series, the latest slot takes the players to San Francisco Bay.</p>

Besides new theme and sound effects, Relax Gaming’s newest title provides players with a chance to win big prizes.</p>
<p>The new game features traditional card symbols combined with special characters.

<p>More importantly, Hellcatraz 2 features Relax Gaming’s popular mechanic Dream Drop Jackpots. Thanks to the unique mechanic, seven people became millionaires in less than a year since its launch.</p>
<p>The New Game Delivers Engaging and Rewarding Features</p>
<p>Shelley Hannah, Relax Gaming’s director of casino products, explained that after the roaring success of the Dream Drop Jackpots games, the company decided to incorporate the innovative mechanic into the sequel of Hellcatraz. She predicted that the new game will be well received by the players online. “Hellcatraz 2 provides a unique environment to experience what Dream Drop has to offer, packed full of excitement and all the action and playability that Relax is renowned for,” said Hannah in conclusion.</p>
<p>“We have seen fantastic success with our Dream Drop Jackpots titles and incorporating the mechanic into our Hellcatraz series was a natural decision, and one we knew that players would love!“ Shelley Hannah, director of casino products at Relax Gaming</p>
<p>Elevating the experience for the players, Hellcatraz 2 offers a Mystery Reveal feature. This can help activate some 59,049 ways to win. On the other hand, players that want to activate the Dream Drop Bonus need to see 5 Dream Drop Symbols within the top row before a normal spin. Overall, the mechanic offers five different sizes of jackpots: Mega, Major, Maxi, Midi and Rapid. The online players are presented with 15 options and they need to uncover 3 symbols with the same jackpot to win it.</p>
