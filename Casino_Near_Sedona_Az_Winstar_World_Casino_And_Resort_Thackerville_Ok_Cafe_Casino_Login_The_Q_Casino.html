<p>Malta’s gaming regulator, the MGA has announced the launch of a new online platform that can be used to report suspicious betting activities. The Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism is already live from November 23 and Malta-licensed operators can use it ahead of the planned launch on January 1, 2021.</p>
<p>MGA Launches Tool for Suspicious Betting Reporting</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) announced the launch of a new online platform that can be used by operators to report suspicious betting activities. The new platform is operational from November 23 and each report which is submitted is reviewed by MGA’s Sports Integrity Unit (SIU). The online reporting platform is known as Suspicious Betting Reporting Mechanism (SBRM) and is available for all licensed sports betting operators in Malta.</p>
<p>The MGA revealed that the initial launch of the SBRM was planned for January 1, 2021. In fact, starting from January 1, any suspicious betting activities must be reported by the Malta-licensed operators to the regulator.</p>
<p>However, the regulator introduced the platform ahead of the planned date in order to prepare the operators for a smoother transition. By introducing the tool earlier, MGA also gives the licensed operators a chance to prepare and implement changes where necessary.</p>
<p>In an effort to increase its resources to fight against the manipulation of sports competitions, the MGA created the SIU back in August 2019. The unit’s main goal since its creation has been to gather intelligence and information relating to suspicious betting and liaise with local and foreign regulatory authorities, monitoring systems, and more.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, in May, the regulator published a consultation paper on “Suspicious Betting Reporting Requirements and other Matters“. The objective of the consultation was to gather feedback from the operators in light of the proposed betting reporting requirements which the MGA plans to implement in an effort to safeguard the integrity of sports and sports betting.</p>
<p>Consequently, the SBRM platform was created, which as noted is already operational and can be used by licensed operators in Malta.</p>
