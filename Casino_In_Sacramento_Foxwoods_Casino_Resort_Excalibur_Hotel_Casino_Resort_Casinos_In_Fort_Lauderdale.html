    <h1>Casino In Sacramento Foxwoods Casino Resort Excalibur Hotel Casino Resort Casinos In Fort Lauderdale</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I made a mistake and deposited on this site from a third party (I used the withdrawal from another site to deposit on BK8 just to speed up the process of depositing). The deposit did not went automatically as in any other site. I chatted with BK8 and provided them with the hash, the account address from which the money was sent and also screenshot of the address on my BK8 account. Everything turned up perfectly; they have received the money and I have been honest since the first interaction with them that I made the mistake to deposit from a third party. They refused to finish the deposit asking for the receipt of the deposit made from the wallet, knowing perfectly that I can't provide that. I even asked the site that sent the money to make a screenshot but they told me that this is against their rules. BK8 asked me for the correspondence with the site in question and I sent it to them but they again refused today to deposit my money. Really frustrating and I feel that they want just to profit from the mistake. Strange because I'm in a losing run with them....</p>
<p>Attached the transaction where the address can be perfectly seen, also my depositing address to the BK8 and also the correspondence with the site that made the transaction that for security reasons they cant send me a screenshot from the wallet</p>
