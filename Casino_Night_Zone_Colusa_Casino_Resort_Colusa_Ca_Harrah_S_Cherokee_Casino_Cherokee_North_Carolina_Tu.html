<p>The Cromwell Set to Become the First Adults-Only on the Strip</p>
<p>Nasdaq-listed casino giant Caesars Entertainment, Inc. announced Thursday plans to resume operations at The Cromwell. Scheduled to re-open October 29, the boutique hotel of the casino complex which is set to become the first adults-only on the Strip, will be open seven days a week.</p>
<p>The Cromwell Joins the List</p>
<p>The re-opening of the first standalone boutique hotel on Las Vegas Boulevard will follow the successful resumption of operations at Caesars Palace Las Vegas, Flamingo Las Vegas, Harrah’s Las Vegas, Paris Las Vegas, Bally’s Las Vegas, The LINQ Hotel + Experience, Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino, as well as The LINQ Promenade, High Roller Observation Wheel, FLY LINQ and Eiffel Tower Viewing Deck.</p>
<p>The property which received the Forbes Travel Guide Recommended Award for several consecutive years is located just across from Caesars Palace, at the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road. It brings an exclusive experience to the destination, emphasizing the importance of hospitality, amenities and personalized service, Senior Vice President and General Manager at The Cromwell, Ken Janssen outlined.</p>
<p>The hotel at The Cromwell comprises of 188 rooms including 19 suites, while the casino is spread across 40,000 square feet, offering one of the best odds to win big in Vegas, featuring a high-limit slot area, single zero roulette, EZ Baccarat and 100x odds Craps tables, as well as 3-2 shoe and double-deck blackjack.</p>
<p>On re-opening day The Cromwell will present its new William Hill-branded sports book, which will offer sports fans and bettors self-servicing wagering kiosks and an expanded betting menu for live in-play betting. William Hill is currently a subject of a £2.9 billion takeover bid from Caesars Entertainment.</p>
<p>The casino resort also offers the experience of Bound, an elevated lobby lounge, GIADA, an award-winning restaurant by celebrity chef and TV personality Giada De Laurentis, Interlude Casino Lounge, and the fast-casual eatwell and Drai’s After Hours, located beneath the boutique hotel.</p>
<p>The 21 and above only admission rule for the hotel and casino at The Cromwell will not be valid for GIADA where guests of all ages will be admitted, while the fast-casual restaurant will resume operations for fast-casual service and mobile orders.</p>
<p>The resumption of business at The Cromwell is following the re-opening of Caesars’ regional casinos and hotels across the US, in line with customer demand and regulatory and health and safety requirements. The casino operator is fostering a culture around the well-being of its employees and guests, and is implementing physical distancing practices and enhanced cleaning and sanitization protocols.</p>
<p>Caesars is also making available the masks, as they are mandatory for wearing by guests and employees for all of its properties, besides the health screening program for its employees.</p>
