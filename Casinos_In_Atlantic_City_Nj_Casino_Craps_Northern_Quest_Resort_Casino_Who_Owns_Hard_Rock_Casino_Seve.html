    <h1>Casinos In Atlantic City Nj Casino Craps Northern Quest Resort Casino Who Owns Hard Rock Casino Seve</h1>

<p>No matter who insults you here or blames you, don't take it so seriously dear RadkaðŸŒ´</p>
<p>many think that every casino listed by you is automatically 100% affiliated with you, unfortunately they do not understand that you are a portal that mediates and some more.</p>
<p>Most think that if a casino is listed here, you are automatically affiliated with the respective casino and have a say, which is not the case.</p>
<p>When people are frustrated, it's easy to blame others ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>I wouldn't take all these threats and insults against you too seriously anyway.</p>
<p>It's absolutely your fault if others don't READ!</p>
<p>As you can see very well in this forum here, there are many who talk without reading, so don't let that bother you.</p>
<p>To all members &amp; players, the Guru team is not responsible for the casino's failures!</p>
<p>You can't give a casino a bad review based on guesswork because you DON'T KNOW who is behind it.</p>
<p>This is the case with many casinos and Guru is not the FBI ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>The suggestion that they're from Wild Pharaoh is a guess, but no one here has hard evidence for that.</p>
<p>For example, the wannabe Internet lawyer said weeks ago that his Skype had been changed from Wildpharaoh to Scatterhall, but didn't upload proof once, just talked again.</p>
<p>I warned players about this 4-5 months ago because I suspected it very strongly but had NO hard evidence!</p>
<p>For example, just because I now have that suspicion, even if it's strong, I can't just hurt a casino just because I "suspect" it.</p>
<p>Imagine if we lived in a world where you put people in jail just for suspecting something. ^^</p>
<p>I ABSOLUTELY understand the players' frustration! That's why it was important to me to enlighten people, but here almost nobody reads correctly and then complains to others, although everyone is responsible themselves.</p>
<p>Fresh casinos are always a risk, that's why the Guru team also writes "It's a fresh casino and ZEIT will show what rating it will get".</p>
<p>Initially you go to the terms and conditions and see how fair they are, you generally check the site and if you feel that it has good service and seems fair you give a rating accordingly but say it's a fresh casino is and no one really knows anything about it.</p>
<p>Complain to the casinos, not Guru.</p>
<p>There are still so many casinos out there that aren't listed on Guru because they also don't know 100% when new casinos are opening and whatnot.</p>
<p>Some find them personally, others as tips from players or the casinos send inquiries themselves.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, Guru is a site that mainly INTERMEDIES and not as the casino itself has any say.</p>
<p>As I said before, fresh casinos are always a risk.</p>
<p>In the future, wait and see and don't rush to all casinos just because they offer 250% bonuses.</p>
<p>Not everything that glitters is gold.</p>
<p>I would ask you to take a close look at how this platform works here and stop insulting the employees or threatening them with lawyers.</p>
<p>You won't get very far with lawyers either, as these lawyers will tell you that it's your own fault.</p>
<p>Make the owners by heart and complain to them, because apart from the owners, nobody can help you anymore.</p>
