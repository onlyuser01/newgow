<p>William Hill Vegas, a leading online gambling operator, has joined forces with Live 5, one of the United Kingdom’s leading providers of digital gaming content. Under the agreement, the studio will provide the operator with a new branded slot.</p>
<p>Live 5 Developed William Hill Vegas Lighting Lines for the Operator</p>
<p>As agreed, Live 5 will help William Hill Vegas roll out an exclusive William Hill-branded slot called William Hill Vegas Lighting Lines. The exceptional new title, the developer said, provides players with tons of lucrative opportunities.</p>
<p>The new slot boasts a maximum win of 5,000x the initial bet and has а Return to Player rate of 92%. The volatility is set to mid to high, allowing players to experience some serious thrills while earning rewards.</p>
<p>William Hill Vegas Lighting Lines will leverage Live 5’s proprietary features to ensure more exciting experiences for bettors. If a winning combination occurs on a LightingLine, lightning will strike the line, after which a Prize Wheel will be triggered. Players will get to spin the wheel once or every LightingLine they activate. The wheel has the potential to further multiply a player’s bet or provide them with free spins.</p>
<p>The new game will be exclusively available on William Hill Vegas, allowing the operator to stand out from its competitors.</p>
<p>William Hill Is Very Happy with the Game</p>
<p>Live 5’s chief executive officer, Lloyd Butler, said that the new title is all about enhancing the player experience. The studio’s vision was to create a game where players excitedly wait to spin the Prize Wheel and multiply their bet. Because of that, Butler believes, William Hill Vegas Lighting Lines will provide players with “truly electric” experiences.</p>
<p>Butler added that it has been a pleasure to work with William Hill and create such a thrilling game for the operator. He is sure that players will have experiences that are positively charged.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Craig Staples, head of gaming content at William Hill, said that his company is always looking for great content for its customers. He said that exciting games are crucial to the operator’s success, which is why it always prefers to offer titles that are not available anywhere else. Staples added that Live 5 did an amazing job of making Lighting Lines stand out.</p>
<p>Working with the team at Live 5 has been a pleasure and the result, William Hill Vegas Lightning Lines, is a slot that stands out from the others in our lobby and delivers a fun, thrilling and compelling experience with big excitement and big win potential with every spin.

<p>A month ago, Live 5 also provided 888casino with new content.</p>
