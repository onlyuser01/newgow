    <h1>Iowa Casino Redding Casino Indian Casino Vicksburg Casino Hotels Fortune Coins Sweeps Casino Hollywo</h1>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I urgently need help.</p>
<p>I won a sum of 11000€ at 1Bet on the 22nd of January, 2024.</p>
<p>My first attempted withdrawal of 9900€ on the 24th of January, 2024 was rejected on the 25th of January, 2024 due to a violation of Terms and Conditions (1BET had updated their T&amp;Cs).</p>
<p>So, I submitted a second withdrawal on the 25th of January, 2024 for 5000€ which was declined on the 31st of January, 2024 due to technical issues. Okay, then, a third withdrawal of 5000€ was submitted on the 1st of February, 2024, and now it's getting scandalous. On the morning of the 3rd of February, 2024, I checked my account to see if there were any updates or if I'd received a message - nothing. This morning, on the 4th of February, 2024, I check and lo and behold - all my winnings have vanished - I immediately contacted their chat support - they suggested I check my betting history in the casino - and lo and behold my money has been gambled away. I just want to clarify - no one else had my login details, I only play on my PC, and I have a very secure password. The timeframe in which I allegedly played, on Saturday, the 3rd of February, 2024, from 21:00 - 22:33, I can confirm that I was at a birthday party, and 12 individuals could corroborate this. The 1Bet chat service has now forwarded this case to a specialist. I want nothing more than the winnings that are rightfully mine. They were quite happy to accept my deposits, after all.</p>
