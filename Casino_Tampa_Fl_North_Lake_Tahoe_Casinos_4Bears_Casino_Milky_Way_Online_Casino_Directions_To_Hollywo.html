<p>A wide range of union members working at the MGM Resorts International’s Gold Strike Hotel &amp; Casino in Tunica, Mississippi, are to receive an increase in wages of between $1.25 and $4.50 per hour on top of their current wages under a new three-year labor agreement approved by a number of labor organizations.</p>
<p>Increased Wages for Local 667 Teamsters Members</p>
<p>The pay rise applies to 50 members of Local 667 Teamsters as well and covers front desk and guest services staff, phone operators, limo drivers, detailers, valets, and warehouse workers. The new contract also specifies wage increases of 2% in 2023 and 3.5% in 2024. On top of that, employees are to get automatic gratuities and bonuses depending on years of service, which may range from $500 to $2,500.</p>
<p>Gambling Venues are fighting to retain and recruit staff in a tight labor market</p>
<p>Veronica Sawyer, assistant director of the teamsters’ convention, trade show, and casino division, has commented: “The wages will help with retention and recruitment”. The new labor agreement will help MGM Resorts hire new staff and offer more competitive salaries and attractive perks in a challenging labor market. The shortage of workers is mainly due to the pandemic as many employees left or are leaving the service industry seeking more reliable opportunities. MGM Resorts is looking to fill the whopping amount of 1,100 roles in its hotel and casino venues across the US. Only in Mississippi, the company is in competition with more than 30 casinos.</p>
<p>Cherokee Nation Businesses acquires Gold Strike</p>
<p>The news about the new labor contract comes at the same time as the announcement by MGM Resorts International that it is selling Gold Strike Hotel &amp; Casino in Tunica, Mississippi, to Cherokee Nation Entertainment Gaming Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of Cherokee Nation Businesses, for $450 million. In regard to the deal, Bill Hornbuckle, CEO &amp; president of MGM International Resorts has said: “Gold Strike is a wonderful property with a bright future ahead of it. Strategically, however, we decided to narrow our focus on Mississippi to just one resort. [with] Beau Rivage.” The deal with CNB is expected to be finalized in the first six months of 2023.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts International is the Las Vegas Strip’s largest operator, owning 33 state-of-the-art hotel and gaming venues that are located both across the US and internationally.</p>
