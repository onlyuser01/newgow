    <h1>Durant Casino Choctaw Casinos Near San Francisco Bronco Billy S Casino Ramona Casino Capitol Casino</h1>

<p>After expanding in South Africa and the African region in general, Gaming Laboratories International (GLI) is doubling down on bringing the right talent</p>
<p>This is why one of the most prominent testing agencies for the casino and gambling industries has now appointed Pierre Otto as its new general manager for South Africa. His shift into the position is still subject to regulatory approval, but the company feels confident about the man’s prospects and role in furthering company growth.</p>
<p>Otto’s pick is not by chance either, as he has been a part of the company since 2017 and he last served as senior engineering manager, prior to the present developments that see him take on an even more responsible role. Before that, he also worked as an engineering manager as well as a compliance and quality manager for the company.</p>
<p>Commenting on his appointment, GLI COO for EMEA, Devon Dalbock, said that the entire organization was very happy to see Otto join the South African team:</p>
<p>His diverse range of experience is incredibly valuable, both to our clients and to our employees. He is a proven leader with the knowledge, skill, and vision to help our clients successfully navigate the industry’s exciting future across Africa. GLI COO for EMEA, Devon Dalbock</p>
<p>Otto already has relevant experience in the industry working in Africa in particular and understanding the subtleties of the specific market and the region as a whole. He worked as senior sales manager for Scientific Games and director for WMS Gaming Africa prior to joining GLI.</p>
<p>His expertise is appreciated and valued, and he will play an instrumental role in GLI’s local footprint and growth in the country he will now be in charge of as part of a larger team.</p>
<p>GLI has also been keen to expand its technical know-how, acquiring iTech Labs in full, a rival and respected testing lab, with the company ever-committed to being the best supplier of certifications for the industry.</p>
