<p>GVC Holdings’ efforts towards safer gambling continued today as the company became the first gambling industry partner for the innovative responsible gaming tool PlayPause, which will be implemented within the BetMGM sports betting app.</p>
<p>Focus on Responsible Gaming</p>
<p>Developed by GeoComply, a leading supplier of geolocation compliance technology, and offered free-of-charge for gaming operators via a non-profit organization, Conscious Gaming, the tool is designed to modernize and strengthen the effectiveness of the industry’s responsible gaming programs.</p>
<p>PlayPause was launched in September, during the Responsible Gaming Education Week, adding new capabilities for operators to manage compliance requirements across multiple states. The solution expands the self-exclusion bubble for players allowing the protection to move along with them in cases they move from state to state.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to be the first official partner of PlayPause. We believe the most responsible operator will be the most successful operator, and PlayPause’s innovative, multi-state approach to responsible gaming in the U.S. aligns with our firm commitment to providing our customers with the safest and most enjoyable experience possible.” Shay Segev, CEO, GVC Holdings</p>
<p>The responsible gambling tool empowers operators to make more data driven decisions based on greater player insights so that if one player has self-excluded in one state can be recognized and protected in case they try to gamble in another. PlayPause also allows players to self-exclude from multiple states to prevent an incident gambling when crossing a state-line.</p>
<p>“A multi-state approach to responsible gaming is an important step for the industry and advances consumer protection in a meaningful way. We’re delighted to play a leading role in collaborating on this important and timely initiative.” Adam Greenblatt, CEO, BetMGM</p>
<p>Managing and operating separate self-exclusion databases for each state increases the burden on gambling operators, but PlayPause has successively tackled the issue by streamlining the administrative burden and eliminating the silos for each database.</p>
<p>Constant Efforts for Player Protection</p>
<p>GVC Holdings, which recently announced it is going to have its name changed to Entain, along with dropping operations for all unregulated jurisdictions, has been at the forefront for responsible gaming efforts. Last week, the operator signed partnerships to beef up player protection by adding new gambling harm detection tools and algorithms based on behavioral and neuro-scientific insights.</p>
<p>In the US, GVC engaged in a multi-year research program into addictive behaviors with the Harvard University, and is a platinum member of the US National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG).</p>
<p>GVC’s joint venture with MGM Resorts, Roar Digital, operating under the BetMGM sports betting and iGaming brand, has already secured presence into 7 US states, after recently launching its sports betting mobile app in Tennessee.</p>
<p>Prior to the launch, BetMGM signed a partnership deal with the Tennessee Titans franchise from the National Football League (NFL).</p>
