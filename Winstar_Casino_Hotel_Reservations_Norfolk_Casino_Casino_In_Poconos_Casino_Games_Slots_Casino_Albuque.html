    <h1>Winstar Casino Hotel Reservations Norfolk Casino Casino In Poconos Casino Games Slots Casino Albuque</h1>

<p>Dear 1xbet Team</p>
<p>First of all this is too much difficult to fulfill your Documentation requirements because you asked my Adhar card,I provided you,Then you asked my Pan Card I provided that too.After that you asked deposit proof,I provided that ,after that you said that we don't accept screenshot from Mobile then I gave you proof of deposit from my PC.After checking my all Documents valid you trying another way to Forfeit my money because not only you but a lot of casino sites are more popular than you but no one hold withdrawal for 180 Days after getting all the proofs and Documents.You didn't believe on me that I have deposited with my own Astropay card that's why I give you my ownership proof.Still you hold my withdrawal for 180 Days this means that a Real Player will waste their time in waiting? If you not beleive and you were investigate yourself by Payment team then why asked all those proofs from me? And if you're thinking that this deposit is made from another's account then why you're not sending back the deposited amount to that account? This is because you're trying to Scam with me that's why you're not sending the deposited amount nor giving any proof where you can proove that the deposit made was suspicious.You're just repeating same thing for waiting 180 Days.Don't be oversmart as CasinoGuru and every player no well that an investigation cannot take more than 24 hours or maximum 7 Days but you have break the limit of Fraud and you directly hold my withdrawal for 6 months (180 Days).You have planned so well how to do Scam because you know well that a complaint cannot be open for 180 Days,You're replying the last date of the reply date,You have collected all the deposit proofs but still not allowing me to withdraw,You're not sending back the amount to that Account which was used to deposit.So overall you're fully trying to forfeit my funds and Now I don't need my money I only need Justice and Boycott such Fraud casino.1xbet should be ban because after taking all the proofs and documents you have blocked my account for over 2 months and also saying to wait for 6 months.Kindly Don't make us fool as CasinoGuru know well how to treat such Frauder's casino site.Allow me to withdraw or block my account permanently but don't be more cleverer here.I hope CasinoGuru already know the matter well that how 1xbet trap a Real player and play with their trust.After reading this Complaint everyone will be fear when they will see that after taking all the documents you have hold withdrawal for 180 Days. I will wait till Sunday for the finall response after that I request CasinoGuru kindly close this complaint as "Unresolved" .I will update here if 1xbet allow me to withdraw or not.If this case will be marked as "Unresolved" then everyone will read this whole matter and will be safe their money from such Scam sites.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
