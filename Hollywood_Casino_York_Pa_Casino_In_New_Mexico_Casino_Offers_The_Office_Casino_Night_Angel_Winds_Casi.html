    <h1>Hollywood Casino York Pa Casino In New Mexico Casino Offers The Office Casino Night Angel Winds Casi</h1>

<p>Ok I have a few things to say here as I have read your entire complaint and all your photos provided as well. I have been playing at BC for 3 years now and have watched it go from tiny online casino with a fraction of the daily active users they have today. my vip level is in the 60's, I have 10 medals, &amp; was one of the beta testers for the vip host program so in other words I had a vip host months before they even announced it. I am by no means an employee of BC nor do I have any affiliation other than a player on the site. In fact I have been very vocal in protest of many decisions BC has made in the last 9 or 10 months. I do not agree with many of the things that the new management team or maybe new ownership, Im not certain if somebody bought BC or they just brought in a new management group to run operations. Actually I was trying to figure that out when casino guru and your complaint came up as one of the results so I was interested and I clicked the link that brought me here.</p>
<p>I said all that to show that I am somewhat of an authority when it comes to playing the games on site but also dealing with support and admin behind the curtain if you will. I want to clarify that I get nothing from BC other than the sad excuse they call bonuses these days.</p>
<p>Now brace yourself cause you arent gonna like what I have to say next.</p>
<p>I can not speak towards your situation where you pressed tails while playing coinflip and it landed tails but they said it was a losing bet. I honestly dont play coinflip very much myself but I have played it and fully understand the rules and gameplay. I can say in the 3 years I have been playing regularly at BC, I have never had anything like that happen in any game nor have I seen or heard about something like that from anybody else in chat or offsite with friends of mine who play there. So that to me seems like an anomaly and support was probably right and it was some sort of visual glitch where it was supposed to show heads but it showed tails instead. Unless you have the full bet slip for that specific game we cant make any insinuations that BC cheated. Also since coinflip is a house game you should have verefied the game and seeds on the blockchain right after that loss. Im guessing you didnt do that since there is no mention of it nor any pics showing this. It has long been a theory of mine that if provably fair casinos were to cheat it would be the micro seconds before a player clicks the bet button with some algorithm or AI making a change to bet outcome before it is locked into the blockchain and cant be tampered with. Anyways I have no clue what the bet made on this game that flipped tails with you also choosing tails but if it was a significant bet and you dont have more games where this type of thing happened then it sounds like a fluke glitch as it is just a website and code can be corrupted for numerous reasons not to mention internet connection strength or even your device used being the culprit. I just dont think this example is going to get you anywhere at all nor does it provide support to your big accusation which i will cover next.</p>
<p>OK so you are very well aware that when you think you "won" $400k that many many other players on the site had the exact same thing happen to them, right? you know you werent the only one that was kicked off site and then had their accounts "corrected' not drained cause you didnt win any part of that 400k and we both know that. You want anybody to believe you won 400k usd playing a single game of coinflip? bs. i call bs. Show a screenshot of the whole bet slip then. I wanna see you starting wager and how many correct picks you made and what it says you multi was at games end. Your photos conveniently avoid showing the real truth and to me that just says that you know you didnt win that money fair and square. I wont jump to a ton of conclusions but I have an idea why you are doing all this and what the real root cause is to your even attempting to reclaim money that was never yours at any point. Just like if a bank mistakenly deposits a million bucks in your account when it was supposed to be sent to an entirely different account, that IS NOT YOUR money at any point and any action you take that isnt informing the proper people that you think a mistake has happened you are essentially committing theft. Which is what you tried to do the day you said you won $400k and you are still trying to steal from the casino opening this case with a third party adjudicator. bruh, you know you didnt win that money fair and square, like all the others who were also locked out for 72 hours as well.</p>
<p>I would drop this case asap cause you are wasting casino gurus time going forward. I hope mods read this tho and i know that what I have said here will be echoed by any rep from BC that speaks about this case.</p>
<p>You won 400k but you said they only took 247k where is the 153k that is missing? where that $?</p>
