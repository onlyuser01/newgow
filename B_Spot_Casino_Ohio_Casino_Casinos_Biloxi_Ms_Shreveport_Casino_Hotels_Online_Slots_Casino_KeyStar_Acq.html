    <h1>B Spot Casino Ohio Casino Casinos Biloxi Ms Shreveport Casino Hotels Online Slots Casino KeyStar Acq</h1>

<p>Supplier of technology for the sports betting, esports and fintech industries KeyStar Corp announced it has acquired the assets of sports betting platform ZenSports and esports brand Ultimate Gamer.</p>
<p>Pursuing Growth in B2C and B2B</p>
<p>Following the acquisition of ZenSports, the underlying fintech backbone of its platform offering sports betting, esports, digital currency, payments, non-fungible token (NFT), content curation, and identity solutions is being leveraged across all KeyStar brands. KeyStar is also making it available as a standalone solution under a newly created brand, Burstive.</p>
<p>KeyStar chief executive officer John Linss outlined the acquisition of ZenSports’ and Ultimate Gamer’s assets as the piece of the puzzle that allowed KeyStar to assemble “a comprehensive platform capability that enables both business-to-business and direct-to-consumer offering” in sports wagering, esports and digital currency markets.</p>
<p>“The establishment of these three pillars represents an opportunity for KeyStar to grow our global business and provide many benefits for both our business and consumer clients,” Linns continued, excited to see ZenSports’ team contribute to the decades of industry experience of the team at KeyStar by joining it, and eager to see both teams collaborate to “grow these product lines and solutions.”</p>
<p>As part of ZenSports’ assets and brand acquisition, the ZenSports team has joined KeyStar, and ZenSports’ co-founder Mark Thomas, who also commented on the acquisition, felt excited at the opportunity “to be partnering with the experienced and innovative team at KeyStar.”</p>
<p>“The combination of KeyStar’s brands and ZenSports technology provides an innovation platform that we believe will position KeyStar as the entertainment, gaming, and fintech technology leader for many years to come,” Thomas concluded.</p>
<p>Following the acquisition of ZenSports’ assets, KeyStar is planning on obtaining gaming licenses for both B2C and B2B operations in the US and internationally to expand its presence in sports betting, while with the creation of the Burstive brand, KeyStar is looking to create white-label fintech solutions by leveraging ZenSports’ proprietary cryptocurrency payments API and trading exchange technology.</p>
<p>Synergies in Sports Betting and Esports</p>
<p>The acquisition of Ultimate Gamer’s assets is providing opportunities for KeyStar in online and live esports competitions, as well as the established brand to unite all hosted and managed by KeyStar esports tournaments, while the combination of ZenSports’ proprietary esports tournament technology with Ultimate Gamer’s esports branding and audience is expected to create an immersive experience for tournaments and one-on-one matches.</p>
<p>The acquisition of ZenSports’ assets does not include the brand’s assets or gaming license in Nevada which was acquired in August last year and, while KeyStar plans to obtain its own license in the state in the near future, in the meantime it will leverage the brand’s betting technology in markets across other jurisdictions.</p>
