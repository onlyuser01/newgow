<p>Wazdan has struck a content partnership with Belgian iGaming operator Napoleon Sports &amp; Casino. The alliance will see the award-winning content studio deliver its full portfolio of casino products to Napoleon, marking the latest expansion in the regulated iGaming market across Europe.</p>
<p>Napoleon Casino Welcomes Wazdan Content</p>
<p>As a result, players will first be introduced to the top-performing titles by Wazdan, including Sizzling Moon, Sun of Fortune, and Magic Fruits Deluxe. The iGaming operator also powers land-based operations, including the Grand along with 25 arcades in Belgium. Wazdan is also planning to release its 9 Coins slot in July which is set to strike home with Belgian players.</p>
<p>Wazdan has been building its footprint across Europe and achieving better brand visibility thanks to its high-quality designs, innovative features, and focused development process which has resulted in the creation of unique gameplay elements, such as Hold the Jackpot and Collect to Infinity.</p>
<p>Wazdan has been growing its footprint in several regions at the same time. The company is well-represented in Europe now as it is pushing to gain more ground in North America, with both the United States and Canada as part of its latest forays.</p>
<p>Wazdan CCO Andrzej Hyla commented on the new partnership with Napoleon Sports &amp; Casino and welcomed the opportunity to be expanding in the Belgian market:</p>
<p>“The brand has an in-depth understanding of its customer base, and we can’t wait to see how their players react to our games.” Wazdan CCO Andrzej Hyla</p>
<p>Wazdan Set to Raise the Content Bar for Napoleon</p>
<p>Napoleon Sports &amp; Casino gaming content manager Melissa Deboelpaep welcomed Wazdan as the operator’s latest content provider and said that the casino was looking forward to providing players with innovative content as envisioned by the developer.</p>
<p>“Together with Wazdan, we’re sure we can offer players an unforgettable experience,” Deboelpaep said.</p>
<p>Wazdan has been scaling up the reach of its products by most recently teaming up with PressEnter Group and agreeing to provide the Malta-based company’s brands with its slot product. The company has also been working on a number of games and fresh releases including 9 Burning Dragons and Sizzling Egg.</p>
