<p>The global sports betting, gaming and interactive entertainment group, Entain, released its second quarter and the first half of 2022 results. The second quarter covers the period from April 1 through June 30, 2022, while H1, covers the period between January 1 and June 30, 2022.</p>
<p>Entain confirmed that in Q2 and H1, it has seen a decline in revenue for its online operations. However, that negative effect was offset thanks to a significant increase in the retail sector, the company revealed.</p>
<p>In H1, the net gaming revenue (NGR) for Entain's online operations decreased by 7%. A similar decrease of 7% in online NGR was also observed in Q2. However, the company's retail operations NGR increased by 243% in H1. The positive increase in retail NGR was also evident in Q2 when the company recorded a 79% increase. Given the decrease in online NGR and increase from the retail sector, overall, Entain's NGR in Q2 increased by 8%. Not unexpectedly, the group's total NGR for H1 increased by 18%.</p>
<p>In a statement released Thursday, Entain's CEO, Jette Nygaard-Andersen, said: "I am very pleased to see that more customers are choosing to play with us, reflecting our focus on recreational players and putting the customer at the heart of everything we do."</p>
<p>She explained that so far, the company completed four key transactions that helped it grow. According to Nygaard-Andersen, Entain's success is further complemented by the 24% market share of BetMGM in the US. "The macro-economic outlook is uncertain, however the underlying performance of our business remains strong," added Nygaard-Andersen.</p>
<p>She acknowledged that Entain's customer base continues to grow. At the same time, the company remains focused on proving the best services for its customers and expanding. In conclusion, Nygaard-Andersen said: "Our leadership in responsibility and sustainability has seen us implementfurther player safety measures alongside ARC, particularly in the UK, as well as respond to regulatory changes as markets implement regulation."</p>
<p>According to the recent announcement, Entain's retail sector growth was primarily driven by gaming and self-service betting terminals. Additionally, the company acknowledged that in Q2, the retail segment surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Further growth is expected upon the completion of the transaction with BetCity, which according to Entain will create a new strategic opportunity for the Dutch market.</p>
<p>Other important highlights as a part of Q2 include the appointment of Rahul Welde as non-executive director back in June. Before that, in May, the company was awarded GamCare's Advanced Safer Gambling Standard for its land-based and online operations in the UK. This reaffirmed Entain's commitment to player protection and social responsibility.</p>
