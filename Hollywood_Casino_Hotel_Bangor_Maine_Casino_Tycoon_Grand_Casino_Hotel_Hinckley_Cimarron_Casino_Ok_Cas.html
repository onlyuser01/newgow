    <h1>Hollywood Casino Hotel Bangor Maine Casino Tycoon Grand Casino Hotel Hinckley Cimarron Casino Ok Cas</h1>

<p>UK-based sports software for the sports betting and gaming industries provider Fantasy Sports Interactive (FSI) announced on its website it entered into a strategic partnership deal with Scientific Games (SG). As per the terms of the deal, the SG’s global customer network will feature the original Fantasy Sportsbook offerings of FSI.</p>
<p>FSI’s Fantasy Sportsbook into SG’s Open Market</p>
<p>FSI’s Fantasy Sportsbook solutions, as well as Fantasy Sports products, will be available either as a whole or as a standalone version depending on the need of the specific operator, as Scientific Games will integrate FSI’s proprietary software into its Open Market sports content offering, allowing sportsbook operators access to the new products through a single integration.</p>
<p>“Partnering with Fantasy Sports Interactive is an important move as we continue to bolster our content offering with OpenMarket™. Sportsbooks can now seamlessly expand their portfolio with FSI’s innovative range of fantasy sports products through OpenMarket, with the sports betting content aggregation platform providing quick access to such exciting content.” Keith O’Loughlin, SVP Sportsbook, Digital, Scientific Games</p>
<p>The Fantasy Suit of FSI will come as a betting addition and diverse skill gaming to the iGaming portfolio of Scientific Games and will be used to cross-sell, as a user engagement acquisition tool, as well as a fantasy betting offering that will enable a standard sportsbook to stand out.</p>
<p>“We are proud and excited to enter a partnership with the world’s leading digital gaming supplier. We look forward to working closely together to reach a global, quality audience with FSI’s exclusive, engaging products, and we are certain this will be a fruitful collaboration that will yield positive results for both companies and the iGaming industry as a whole.” Dennis Tsalikis, CEO, Fantasy Sports Interactive</p>
<p>Expanding on AI Application</p>
<p>The offerings that will be available to SG’s Open Market will be based on FSI’s native fantasy scoring system and exclusive fantasy odds feed, which will separately be made available to SG for further use. The unique feature of FSI’s Sportsbook suite, Fixed-Odds-Fantasy, is that it is the first fantasy sportsbook product that is based on an odds feed, generated by an AI-based fantasy odds generation algorithm.</p>
<p>The Fantasy Sports Interactive deal for the gaming technology solutions provider Scientific Games is the latest in a series of strategic partnerships within the industry. Recently, the Las Vegas- headquartered provider of fully integrated technology platforms signed a deal with Vaix.ai AI engine, to ensure a more engaging and personalized online gaming experience through the integration of an AI algorithm into its existing products.</p>
