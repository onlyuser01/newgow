<p>Leading iGaming aggregator and developer of original gaming content Relax Gaming has launched in the Greek market with Novibet, a prominent local brand. This comes shortly after the company obtained a license from the Hellenic Gaming Commission at the beginning of 2023, allowing it to bring its library of titles to the newly-regulated market in the country.</p>
<p>Players in Greece will now have access to some outstanding choices when it comes to Relax Gaming’s products, including Money Train 2, Temple Tumble 2, and Book of Power, amongst others. Novibet players will also gain access to the content provided through Relax Gaming’s Silver Bullet partner platform which features a number of high-performing suppliers and their products.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, Relax Gaming Chief Commercial Officer Nadiya Attard said that the company was absolutely stoked to have the chance to expand its reach in the regulated Greek market and establish itself as a leader locally.</p>
<p>A similar sentiment was expressed and shared by Novibet Casino Product &amp; CRM Director Foteini Matthaiou who said that the operator was very excited to see its library enriched with some of the world’s best-performing titles, amongst which Money Train 2.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming has been growing its own library of original content as well as partner studios. The company introduced the Banana Town Dream Drop slot game last week and it recently featured Studio 21 as its latest supplier partner.</p>
<p>Both Novibet and Relax Gaming are confident that their collaboration on the Greek market will allow them to reap significant benefits in the long run. In the meantime, Relax Gaming has been able to win significant accolades, consolidating its presence in the industry as one of the best suppliers to explore.</p>
