<p>It’s time for the second Triple Crown series race of 2023. The Middle Jewel of US horseracing is on the program on Saturday, May 20, at Pimlico Race Course in Maryland</p>
<p>The 2023 Preakness Stakes is on the program this weekend, and everyone seems to think the Middle Jewel is going to be even more exciting than the first race of the Triple Crown Series. Oddsmakers are giving three-figure odds on four horses, suggesting that Saturday’s race is going to be a real thriller.</p>

<p>Reasons Why Mage is the +200 Favorite</p>
<p>Trained by Venezuelan Triple Crown winner Gustavo Delgado, Mage is coming to Pimlico as the No. 1 favorite to win the 2023 Preakness Stakes. The main reason for this is that Mage is the horse that won the Kentucky Derby just two weeks later.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that Mage arrived at Churchill Downs as a betting underdog, priced at +2000 at most online betting sites. This time, the three-year-old colt is the main favorite with odds of +200. However, one needs to keep in mind that surprises do happen in the Triple Crown series. So, if a surprise is going to happen on Saturday, which horse will be behind it?</p>
<p>Other 2023 Preakness Runners to Watch Out For</p>
<p>Mage is the only Kentucky Derby runner that will take the stage at Pimlico this weekend. All the other horses (and their jockeys and trainers) have been 100% focused on this race. Sure, Mage probably has a superior physique to all of them, especially when it comes to the late charge, as we witnessed two days ago in Kentucky.</p>
<p>The only horse that comes anywhere near Mage is First Mission. Trained by Brad Cox, this horse has won two of his last three starts. In his most recent outing, First Mission won the G3 Lexington, getting an Equibase rating of 103.</p>
<p>2023 Preakness Stakes Prediction</p>
<p>Mage staged an upset at the first Triple Crown race of the season, but now everyone knows his jockey’s strategy. Rival teams are working hard to prepare for the race, figuring out a way to prevent Mage from having another flying start near the end.</p>
<p>We don’t think Mage will win this race, but who will? Anything can happen in a race like this, but if we had to pick one horse, it would be First Mission. Plus, his odds of +265 make him a pretty decent option.</p>
<p>Pick: First Mission to win</p>
