<p>Neccton will now be further deployed with Casumo as part of a partnership between the latter and the solution’s owner, OpenBet</p>
<p>Thanks to this expanded tie-up, Casumo, a leading casino, will benefit from Neccton’s well-established track record for enhancing responsible gambling and anti-money laundering capabilities in multiple regulated markets.</p>
<p>For context, Casumo and Neccton first teamed up in February 2022. The latter company did not become a part of the OpenBet portfolio until 2023.</p>
<p>Expanding the Partnership to Improve RG and AML</p>
<p>The partnership will cover the United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain, and Malta, as well as Gibraltar and Ontario, Canada. Neccton is designed to bring awareness to existing issues with a customer’s gameplay, by focusing on the player rather than rerouting the process through the operator.</p>
<p>The automated and powerful software serves as a pathfinder for the operator to follow and ensure that RG and AML standards are met in full, and importantly, that consumers benefit from a leading solution when it comes to controlling their gambling habits.</p>
<p>Casumo is one of the long-standing casinos in the industry and as such, it is fully committed to ensuring that its reputation for doing fairly by consumers and upholding robust industry standards is actually on point.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, Neccton managing Director Michael Auer said that expanding the collaboration with Casumo was an important step forward for ensuring that player protection and safer gambling experiences are the core mission that the casino wants to fulfil as part of its business operations.</p>
<p>“Neccton’s all-in-one solution guarantees that Casumo gains access to industry-leading software, equipped with player profiling and comprehensive reporting capabilities. This integration will not only enhance the overall betting experience but also ensure its utmost security,” Dr Auer added.</p>
<p>Casumo chief customer expeirence officer Sandhya Singh was similarly welcoming of the opportunity to partner and boost the operator’s player-protection safeguards through Neccton. Singh called player protection an “integral part” of everything that Casumo does.</p>
<p>Staying Proactive in Helping Players Be Protected</p>
<p>Through deploying Neccton’s powerful real-time solutions, Casumo has the means to proactively monitor players and ensure that it builds a sustainable relationship with its player base while deploying advanced and reliable solutions across the board.</p>
<p>Casumo has been very particular about ensuring that it has the means to protect consumers and it partnered with mkodo for its geolocation software in Ontario, Canada, to ensure that the company maintains compliance with local regulations.</p>
