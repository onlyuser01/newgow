<p>The partnership will contribute to the growth of both companies, representatives believe</p>
<p>Massive Gaming (MVG), a major provider of content and solutions to the international gambling sector, has minted a new partnership deal with FreeStyle Gaming (FSG), a provider of casino solutions. Under the agreement, the latter company will incorporate MVG’s cutting-edge slot game portfolio into its offerings.</p>
<p>The agreement was officialized last year at a signing ceremony in Las Vegas. It is expected to not only bolster FSG’s product offering and allow it to introduce new games to its clients but also expand MVG’s global footprint, allowing its content to reach many new operators and consumers.</p>
<p>MVG is a subsidiary of Neowiz – a Korea Stock Exchange-listed game company – and excels in delivering a vast range of B2B iGaming content and solutions. The games it develops include slots, table games and crash games, allowing it to appeal to a large customer base. In the meantime, the company also offers a casino management system and live streaming services.</p>
<p>FSG, on the other hand, is a company known for designing, developing and distributing casino solutions, powering partners across Asia, Europe and America.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Help Both Companies Grow</p>
<p>Representatives reflected on the new agreement, expressing their enthusiasm about the new partnership. George Cho, MVG’s chief executive officer, said that his team is delighted to team up with FSG and inject its slots into its offerings. According to Cho, the deal will reinforce both parties’ international presence.</p>
<p>We believe this partnership will strengthen our position in the global market and contribute to the growth of both companies. George Cho, CEO, Massive Gaming</p>
<p>Lim Chee Heong, FSG’s director, also commented on the matter, underscoring his team’s commitment to delivering best-in-class games and solutions to its partners. According to him, MVG’s cutting-edge content aligns perfectly with his team’s vision.</p>
<p>We look forward to the opportunities and innovations this partnership will bring to our portfolio. Lim Chee Heong, director, FreeStyle Gaming</p>
<p>In other news, Neowiz, MVG’s parent company, recently entered into a joint production agreement with Kangwon Land – South Korea’s sole domestic casino operator. Under the deal, Neowiz agreed to develop slot machines for the company, helping it showcase its commitment to innovation and growth.</p>
