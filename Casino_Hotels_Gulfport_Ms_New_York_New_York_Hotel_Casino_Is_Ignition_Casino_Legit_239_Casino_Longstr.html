<p>Caesars will continue to benefit from the industry’s most comprehensive suite of betting products and entertainment tools</p>
<p>Less than a week after securing certification in Kansas, Sportradar, an international sports data analyst, unveiled an expansion of its existing partnership with Caesars Sportsbook. As a result, the former company will continue to supply the Caesars Entertainment-owned sports betting platform with data for some of the biggest leagues.</p>
<p>As announced, Sportradar will continue powering Caesars Sportsbook with sports betting data for the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League.</p>
<p>In addition, the expanded partnership will see Sportradar supply its partner with access to certain NBA optical tracking data for the first time. For reference, this data is exclusively provided by Sportradar thanks to its partnership with the basketball association.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new NBA data, Caesars Sportsbook will be able to provide fans with new props while further growing same-game parlays. This will provide an additional boost to the already expansive in-play betting opportunities Caesars offers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the partnership extension will allow Caesars to continue benefitting from the industry’s most comprehensive suite of betting products and entertainment tools. As per the deal, Sportradar will continue to supply pre-match data, content solutions, live match trackers and live data to the sports betting operator.</p>
<p>The Deal Will Benefit Both Parties</p>
<p>Representatives from the two companies released statements on the expanded agreement with Ed Blonk, Sportradar’s chief commercial officer, saying:</p>
<p>As in-play betting increases in prominence in the US, the fast, accurate and reliable data that Sportradar curates will play a critical role in contributing to Caesars’ efforts to maximize revenue opportunities. Ed Blonk, CCO, Sportradar</p>
<p>Blonk added that his team is excited to expand its relationship with Caesars and is looking forward to providing Caesars Sportsbook with the data and tools needed to deliver engaging experiences to customers. He noted that the deal helps Sportradar capitalize on its partnerships with big sports leagues.</p>
<p>Speaking about partnerships with sports bodies, Sportradar just secured exclusive global audio and video and betting data rights of the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kenneth Fuchs, Caesars Digital’s chief operating officer &amp; head of sports, also commented on the matter, expressing his company’s desire to always bring the best possible experience to the customers. To that end, the company is happy to continue its partnership with Sportradar.</p>
<p>Our partnership with Sportradar will provide us new and valuable data to further expand our unique offerings. Kenneth Fuchs, COO &amp; head of sports, Caesars Digital</p>
<p>In May, Caesars Digital expanded its offering in Pennsylvania thanks to an agreement with Evolution.</p>
