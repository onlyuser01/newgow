<p>Black stated that during his career, he’s had the chance to cover some of the biggest sports moments in the history of Canada, but he’s always been passionate about engaging with fans and that is why he’s looking forward to working with NorthStar and being the ambassador and host for NorthStar Bets.</p>
<p>As a recognition of his achievements, Black has received numerous awards with the most prestigious being Sports Media Canada Award for Outstanding Sports Broadcaster. He’s also a five-time Canada’s Best Sportscaster Gemini Award nominee.</p>
