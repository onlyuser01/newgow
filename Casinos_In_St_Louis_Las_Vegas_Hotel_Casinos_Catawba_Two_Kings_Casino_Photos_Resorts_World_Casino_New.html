    <h1>Casinos In St Louis Las Vegas Hotel Casinos Catawba Two Kings Casino Photos Resorts World Casino New</h1>

<p>Thank you, Sefyu24, for your email and for forwarding your RGIAJ self-exclusion documentation. I’m sure that you are aware of the geolocation of DGOJ operation:</p>
<p>"What is self-prohibition?</p>
<p>If you have a problem with gambling, you can register in the Register of Gambling Access Bans (RGIAJ) of the Directorate-General for Gambling’s Regulation (DGOJ). It is registration with self-prohibition in gambling halls that require a prior registration to play, which includes the different operators that act legally in Spain. Anyone can request their inclusion in the RGIAJ, which will prevent them from browsing online gambling operators’ pages."</p>
<p>Since you have chosen a casino with a Curaçao license, it will be very difficult to resolve this case to your satisfaction.</p>
<p>When applying for the self-exclusion, state clearly the reason why you want your account to be deactivated and specify the time period. Also, email "Subject" should be clearly marked and easily recognizable as casino support receives many requests per day hence, if it’s visibly marked you stand a better chance to have your request granted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Email subject: Self-exclusion</p>
<p>Player’s info:</p>
<p>First name:</p>
<p>Last name:</p>
<p>DOB:</p>
<p>Casino login:</p>
<p>Email address:</p>
<p>"Greetings JackMillion Casino,</p>
<p>I’m writing to inform you that I wish to exclude immediately from this casino and from receiving any gambling-related marketing material for a minimum period of xxx months/years (lifetime).</p>
<p>The reason that preceded my decision is xxx</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I will not be allowed to rescind my self-exclusion during this period and self-exclusion cannot be lifted before the end of the agreed period."</p>
<p>Please send another email to support@jackmillion.com (you can CC me at petronela.k@casino.guru in the copy) and keep me informed about any further developments. If there is any option for an alternative contact such as live chat or WhatsApp, please try that too and save screenshots of the relevant communication.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you also have the option to utilize our Self-Exclusion Assistance Tool. This tool allows you to block your casino accounts across multiple gambling establishments simultaneously and is not affiliated with any specific casino. The Self-Exclusion Assistance Tool was designed to assist individuals who may be facing challenges with their gambling habits by helping them limit their access to gambling and reduce the potential for further harm.</p>
