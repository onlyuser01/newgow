    <h1>Casino In Mount Pleasant Sunland Park Casino Hooters Casino Las Vegas Circa Resort And Casino Real O</h1>

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>Juicy vegas casino is blocked my account after I did my 2 nd withdrawal request.I played100$ no Deposit bonus and I won after I did withdraw request and 50$ deposit and waiting for 1 week then I asked from customer support they says my withdrawal is on next batch,But the day after they cancelled my request and 100$ back to casino account then I did again withdrawal requesting then they asked me to send my birth certificate I send them back and the thing is this is my 2nd withdraw request and 1 st one I did all ready and they processed.in that case my account is totally verified and the second withdrawal request they asked from me my birth certificate after I send them they says you withdrwal is reviewed tomorrow and they will processed,that was yesterday.so today I try to open my account its blocked by the finance I asked them the reason they says its on management diccesion and we are not open your account.</p>
<p>This is really wasting with the peoples money and time who playing this casino.without any reasons And my pending withdrawal request they blocked by their own management decision.i am questioning why they not asked from me about my 1 st withdrawal request any further verifications such as a birth certificate.and if my account get verified why they asked me again and again further verifications,if they want to blocked my account any case why they processed 1st withdrawal and why they were waiting for once I deposit 50 $ and how they blocked after verified account.I am not doing any fake dramas.I am really disappointed that what they did to me and please get this matter solve and get my withdrawal back to my wallet.</p>
