    <h1>Casino For Real Money Bay Mills Resort And Casino Casino Rhode Island Tropicana Casino In Atlantic C</h1>

<p>Details of my sunrise slots complain</p>
<p>So, I won 3 of their $1000 USD free roll tournaments following their T&amp;C and "casino rules", (which are different) so when I tried to withdraw my winnings by submitting 2 different withdrawals request on 2 different days on the amounts of $1000.04 and $1500.19 respectively still leaving on my account a positive balance of $74.00 dollars to be able to keep on playing with, the next day after my last withdrawal request on 2023-02-08 they confiscated my total balance of $2574.19 USD using a "managers withdrawal" procedure, for what they have given me 3 different unsupported versions of the reasons for voiding and declining my winnings and withdrawals.</p>
<p>The first excuse was given by "Alison" thought a more than "weird" phone call, she immediately started to make up things like "oh I remember you" "I just talked to you a couple day ago" and continued to make false claims like "I remember telling you that you shouldn’t use "free chips" because now your winnings are voided" and she even dare to say "but don’t worry we have issued a beautiful $100.00 to you that have been authorized already yo make up for your loss" first of all I had never talked to her before, second, I never used free chips before this winnings, and third she was trying to persuade me with $100 instead of helping me to recover my winnings of more than 10 times that ridiculous compensation.</p>
<p>so I email the finance team and Alison responded to me again now as a payouts email agent and then she game me a different reason of why my last 2 mayor withdrawals(mentioned above) were denied. And quote:</p>
<p>——</p>
<p>Hi Liliana</p>
<p>Hope all is well today</p>
<p>As per notes in your account, there is a payment sent to our processor on 02.07 for $122.69 and now we need to wait for our vendor to confirm the transfer to your bank. As soon as we do, we will let you know.</p>
<p>The other 2 requests were denied due to multiple free tournaments in a row. And the amount that was deducted was $2574.19.</p>
<p>Please be advised that according to the TC on our web site a manager withdrawal is used:</p>
<p>https://www.sunrisecasino.com/casino-rules/</p>
<p>An approved "Manager Withdrawal" represents a portion of your balance that was removed because it was not eligible for withdrawal. This amount could be Bonus funds (which are non-cashable) or because you have exceeded the Maximum Withdrawal Amount on your last bonus, with excess funds removed.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that none of our bonuses are cashable therefore said amount will always be removed from the requested amount.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Allison</p>

<p>unquote.</p>
<p>So again, this are 2 different and unsupported reasons of why they declined my withdrawals and confiscated my whole balance in my account</p>
<p>now she’s claiming that I played multiple free tournaments in a row, which is true but what is unsupported is that in more than 3 times I had deposited via Litcoin crypto currency previously to a tournament winning and one of this tournaments winnings was for $1000.00 on 2023-02-05 added to my account at the end of such tournament at 8:05pm ET. So they still owe me this mayor win as I followed their "rules" to win it.</p>
<p>I have to mention that I had previously applied for a withdrawal on the amount of $130.19 and was approved on 2023-02-03 at 12:33pm ET but i haven’t receive yet, so that is probably the "compensation" Allison was referring to looking into my account records, however the numbers still doesn’t match…</p>
<p>Nevertheless, their other explanation of when the "manger withdrawal" is enforced doesn’t apply to my case either because I didn’t use any bonuses to win this tournaments. Both of this last excuses are busted too. However they keep on claiming on their last email reply by the finance team representative NATHAN G*** that those withdrawals were denied due to multiple free tournaments in a row, without recognizing that I had deposited before some tournaments and accordingly to the rules I’m entitled to those winnings. So right there they are violating their own rules.</p>
<p>Besides an other red flag that I encountered on my research of the T&amp;C of this casino is that they have hidden information on a different section called "casino rules" about the specific rule of playing free tournaments in a row. Information that is NOT available on their main T&amp;C section. So with this they mislead to the players to keep on playing free tournaments trying to win big for later do what they did to me and void and confiscate their balances even when they have deposited for it.</p>
<p>My last observation is that Allison provided me with an inexistente or wrong link to review the T&amp;C as I quoted before on her email response.</p>
<p>If more information needed please let me know I can provide any proofs I have several screenshots and records regarding to my case.</p>
<p>have a nice day,</p>
<p>L</p>
