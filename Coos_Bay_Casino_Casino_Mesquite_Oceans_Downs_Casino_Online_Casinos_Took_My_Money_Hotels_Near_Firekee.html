<p>DraftKings has announced an agreement in principle with the Passamaquoddy Tribe for the launch of a mobile sports betting app in Maine</p>
<p>The only US-based sports betting operator integrated vertically, DraftKings Inc., has revealed its plans to launch an online sports wagering app in Maine through a new deal with the Passamaquoddy Tribe, a federally recognized Indian Tribe based in Washington County, Maine.</p>
<p>Maine, Ready to Officially Open the Market</p>
<p>The two parties have reached an agreement in principle which is still subject to the standard licensing and regulatory approvals. The launch will mark the digital sports entertainment and gaming company’s 25th US state launch.</p>
<p>The Passamaquoddy Tribe is one of the four Indigenous tribes that will control the state’s online sports betting market which will officially launch on November 3, at 9 am, according to the Department of Public Safety.</p>
<p>The Penobscot, Maliseet, and Micmac nations are the other three tribes that will hold exclusive rights to operate online sports wagering apps while securing at least half of the mobile revenue. Maine will receive 10% in taxes. Part of the amount will cover federal taxes.</p>
<p>At the end of August, DraftKings opened a permanent sportsbook at Queen Baton Rouge, the gaming establishment built at the site of the previous Hollywood Casino.</p>
<p>The Deal, a “Huge Step Forward” for Local Communities</p>
<p>According to Pleasant Point Tribal government’s chief, Pos Basset, the Sipayik tribe, which is one of the tribe’s two reservations alongside Motahkomikuk, has already expressed its excitement for the deal signed with DraftKings “the industry leaders.”</p>
<p>According to Basset, Sipayik was eager to contribute to introducing sports fans and bettors in Maine to a “first-class mobile sports wagering experience,” calling it a huge step forward for both the local community and the Pine Tree State.</p>
<p>Passamaquoddy Tribe’s chief, William Nicholas, expressed similar views regarding the new partnership, adding they “couldn’t have landed a better organization in the mobile sports wagering arena.” Nicholas also took the opportunity to express their eagerness to see ongoing progress and more investments that will promote the future development of the state.</p>
<p>DraftKing, the Passamaquoddy Tribe’s Official Mobile Sports Betting Provider</p>
<p>According to DraftKing’s co-founder and chief executive officer, Jason Robins, the new relationship with the Tribe which currently counts 3,000 members represents “a fantastic opportunity” for the sportsbook in the context of their plans to introduce Maine customers to safe and legalized forms of sports wagering.</p>
<p>Robins also took the opportunity to express their desire to keep close ties with the Maine Gambling Control Unit. The bureau, which is part of the Department of Public Safety, is responsible for regulating, supervising, and controlling “the ownership and operations of slot machine and table games in casinos and the operation of advance deposit wagering.”</p>
<p>The CEO also explained that the new agreement, which would allow sports aficionados who are at least 21 years old to use their “innovative, immersive and entertaining sportsbook app,” will also turn the company into the official online sports betting provider of the Passamaquoddy Tribe.</p>
<p>Maine customers will be given access to a plethora of betting alternatives ranging from in-game betting, pre-match, same-game-parlay options created in-house, and signature options.</p>
<p>In the same press release used to showcase the new agreement, DraftKings also announced it would make a $100,000 donation to the Lewiston-Auburn Area Response Fund to show support for those who have been affected by the tragic events that occurred in Lewiston last week.</p>
<p>In September, DraftKings announced it would offer Hacksaw Gaming’s gaming content to customers in West Virginia, turning into the second operator to do so.</p>
