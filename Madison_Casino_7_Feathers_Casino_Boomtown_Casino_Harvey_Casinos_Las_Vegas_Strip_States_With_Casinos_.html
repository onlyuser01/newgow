    <h1>Madison Casino 7 Feathers Casino Boomtown Casino Harvey Casinos Las Vegas Strip States With Casinos</h1>

<p>Pragmatic Play has a new chief operating officer in the face of Irina Cornides, who is joining the team to strengthen the supplier’s presence in the iGaming industry. With a strong pull among peers and a proven track record of excellence, Cornides is the right fit for the company, Pragmatic argues.</p>
<p>She has held similar positions, particularly as COO at Gamesys, focusing on the Asian market. Cornides presided over the business’s growth in the region and cultivated valuable and transferable experience.</p>
<p>In her new role at Pragmatic Play, she will work with chief executive officer Julian Jarvis, who has welcomed her appointment. The role of COO has been specially created to prepare Pragmatic Play for the next stage of its expansion.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Happy to Add a Pro</p>
<p>Cornides is the right fit for the company as it seeks to emulate the impressive growth the new COO has as part of its portfolio. With strong roots in the iGaming sector, Pragmatic Play is not an outsider.</p>
<p>Over the years, the company has been able to build up its diverse portfolio, allowing it to enter different aspects of the iGaming experience. The company provides content in live casino, bingo, virtual sports, slots, and more. This comes in a single database along with promotional tools that allow partner brands to quickly deploy and engage with their audiences.</p>
<p>Pragmatic is also certified in 20 jurisdictions and counting. In her new role, Cornides will be tasked with continuing this growth and ensuring that the company achieves better results. She welcomed the opportunity on a high note:</p>
<p>“I am delighted to be joining such a talented team; I’ve long admired Pragmatic Play’s meteoric rise and saw first-hand how much players and operators alike love their games. I look forward to bringing my expertise to the team and working together to make Pragmatic Play into an even bigger success story.” Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has constantly been working on expanding its footprint. At the end of last year, the company signed a contract to power BPlay in Buenos Aires with both slot and live casino games. Elsewhere, the company continued to pursue its growth ambitions and drove its first foray in the East African region through a partnership with Odibets.</p>
<p>Not shunning its multi-pronged approach to new markets, the supplier released dedicated Indian-themed live casino games to continue expanding its portfolio. This pace of development and Cornides’ relevant expertise should poise the company for success.</p>
