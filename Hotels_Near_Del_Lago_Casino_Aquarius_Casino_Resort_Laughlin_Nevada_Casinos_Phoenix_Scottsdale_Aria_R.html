<p>As you know, we do not charge for our services, nor do we accept any gratuities. However, we would appreciate it if you could take a moment to share your experience with our services on Trustpilot https://www.trustpilot.com/evaluate/casino.guru . An honest review and any suggestions you may have to improve our complaint resolution and mediation process would be greatly appreciated. Your feedback could prove helpful to others who are considering contacting us about any online casino-related issues.</p>
<p>I would like to thank both parties for their cooperation. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you encounter any problems with this or any other casino in the future. We are here to help you.</p>
<p>Although you are right that you only partially received the rake-back rewards last week, as you have started to play with them even if you should NOT, you accumulated winnings exceeding the actual full rake-back amount for all your past play. In a generous move, the casino opted not to subtract these winnings and instead allowed you to withdraw your entire balance, including the winnings to which you were technically NOT entitled. This gesture was made in goodwill to completely settle the case, resulting in a more favorable outcome for you. The casino deems no additional funds are owed to you, and your account will remain closed. I believe the casino approach was more than fair. As the complainant confirmed that the funds were successfully received, we consider this complaint to have been successfully resolved. We will now close it as "resolved" in our system.</p>
