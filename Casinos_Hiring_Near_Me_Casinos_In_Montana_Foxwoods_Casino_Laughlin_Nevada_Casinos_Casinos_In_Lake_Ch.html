Finally, Muratov said: "With three more games set to captivate audiences before the year concludes, stay tuned for more immersive gameplay that defines 3 Oaks Gaming."</p>
<p>Players that tap into 3 Oaks Gaming's new slot game should watch out for its Bonus Gold Symbols that are portrayed as Gold Scarabs.

Once this happens, players have a chance to win a Mini, Minor, Major or Grand Jackpot with a prize of x5,000.</p>
<p>According to 3 Oaks Gaming, the Boost feature of the new slot game further propels the engagement of the players. It allows "gathering the existing values on the reels and adding them into the round's winnings," explained the iGaming content provider.</p>
<p>Additionally, Crystal Scarabs: Hold and Win allows players to tap into the Hold and Win Bonus Game by gathering Scarab Symbols via its Bonus Accum mechanic.</p>
<p>The new ancient Egyptian-themed slot comes on the heels of the release of 3 Oaks Gaming's action-packed slot, Grab More Gold! Released earlier this month, Grab More Gold! grants players a chance to secure lucrative prizes and offers thrilling gameplay.</p>
