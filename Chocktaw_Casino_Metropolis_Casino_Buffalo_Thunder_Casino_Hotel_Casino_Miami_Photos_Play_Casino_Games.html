<p>UFC Fight Night 213 a.k.a. UFC Fight Night: Kattar vs. Allen is on the program on Saturday, October 29 at the UFC Apex in Vegas. In this post, we’re going to preview the headliner bout, which is a featherweight clash between the #5 fighter in the divisional rankings, Calvin Kattar (23-6), and #6 Arnold Allen (18-1).</p>
<p>This is going to be the fifth straight five-round bout for Kattar, three of which won the Fight of the Night bonus. Allen, on the other hand, is fighting his first 25-minute fight ever, but oddsmakers don’t see this as a disadvantage for the English fighter. In fact, they think of him as a (slight) favorite to win on Saturday.</p>

<p>Calvin Kattar is UFC’s Marathon Man</p>
<p>The 34-year-old American is 23-6 with 11 wins by KO/TKO, two by submission, and 10 by decision. When it comes to his losses, one happened by submission, while the other five happened by points. That said, 15 of his fights went the distance, which accounts for more than 50% of his pro MMA bouts.</p>
<p>Each of Kattar’s last four bouts went the distance, which is particularly interesting as they were all five-round bouts. He stayed in the octagon for 25 minutes against Dan Ige (unanimous win), Max Holloway (unanimous loss), Giga Chikadze (unanimous win), and Josh Emmett (split decision loss).</p>
<p>Kattar has never been knocked out in his 15+ years long professional career as a mixed martial artist, despite fighting some real KO artists (e.g., Giga Chikadze, Andre Fili, etc.). Is Arnold Allen the man who will change that?</p>
<p>Arnold Allen’s MMA Record Hints at Bigger Things in the Future</p>
<p>Arnold “Almighty” Allen is 18-1 in his career, with his only loss happening back when he was fighting under the banner of Cage Warriors. He lost the fight to Marcin Wrzosek by unanimous decision.</p>
<p>Since moving to the UFC, he’s 9-0 with wins against some pretty good opponents, most notably, Sodiq Yusuff and Dan Hooker. For his TKO win over Hooker, Allen got himself the Performance of the Night bonus.</p>
<p>It was his 10th finish in his career, with six of those being KO/TKO wins, along with four wins by submission. Still, most of those finishes happened before he joined the UFC. While fighting for Dana White’s promotion, we saw Allen win six fights by decision.</p>
<p>Kattar vs. Allen Prediction</p>
<p>This fight isn’t ending until the final bell. Instead, we’ll see these two throwing punches and kicks against one another for full 25 minutes. But who’s going to be the one with his arm raised triumphantly at the end – Calvin Kattar or Arnold Allen?</p>
<p>Our pick is Kattar as he simply has more experience than Allen. Plus, he’s shown multiple times that he’s got the stamina to fight for five whole rounds.</p>
<p>Picks: Calvin Kattar to win by decision</p>
