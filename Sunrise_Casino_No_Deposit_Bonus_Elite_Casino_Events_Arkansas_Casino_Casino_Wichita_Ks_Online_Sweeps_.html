<p>The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) has announced a revised framework for the licensing process, which will now move away from the account managermodel and involve more structures as the regulator seeks to improve licensing conditions and bolster the overall efficiency of the process.</p>
<p>The other parties involved will be known as sub-groups and there will be four of them that will seek to ensure that various aspects of the licensing process are cared for. The UKGC detailed the groups and their responsibilities moving forward.</p>
<p>There will be no more dedicated account managers for each operator in the market, but rather four group-like formations that will work under the names of The Operating License New Group, The Change of Corporate Control Group, The Operating License Vary Group, and The Personal License Group.</p>
<p>Each of these groups is tasked with a particular aspect of the experience while taking into consideration the current licensing conditions and ensuring they are met in full. For example, the New Group will be in charge of processing all new submissions for a license.</p>
<p>The Corporate Control Group will specifically do with any changes in the corporate structure of entities, something that was addressed recently with companies reminded that not reporting changes to their corporate structure could result in license revocation.</p>
<p>The Vary Group will be specifically tasked with processing requests to change anything in existing licenses. Last but not least there will be a separate group dedicated to personal licenses that are issued to casino professionals, such as dealers, croupiers, and other members of the staff who require certification.</p>
<p>The change is necessary, the UKGC believes, as it would offer a more streamlined overall process, making it easier and more efficient to work through any changes and ensuring that there is no technical slowdown. As a result of these changes, the regulator should also be able to optimize its internal processes.</p>
<p>This comes amid a broader debate by the UKGC and lawmakers to have the Gambling Act of 2005 overhauled to better reflect the challenges and realities that operators are facing today. The DCMS has denied rumors that the White Paper supposed to give a preview of these changes is coming this week.</p>
<p>Lawmakers have already urged the DCMS to act quicker and release a draft for public discussions. Versions of the White Paper should be sent to government branches first. More changes could be coming to the UKGC or the way it works as a result of the ongoing review.</p>
