    <h1>Walker Bluff Casino Casino Locations Top 10 Casinos In Vegas Shreveport Casino Hotels Rio Hotel And</h1>

<p>I created account on sportsbet.io made a deposit around 5.55 eth (2115$) and play a bit in tennis and won around 0.90 or 1 eth (350-380 $) and after my account was restricted so they ask for verification, thats no problem, i have send them my documents and after they asked me for extra verification via "VERIFF", this also was passed and verification completed, after that, they ask me about unknown to me usernames . whats relevance I got with them? But i don't know them, honestly maybe their system put me in wrong list!! Im not an arbitrager or tipster i just placed a bet for the first time in crypto currency</p>
<p>But i told them, that this is my one and only account on sportsbet and they can find this out because I don't think that someone have same passport details or face! After that they told me that my deposit will be frozen and no refunded will be made. so please can you help me to return JUST my DEPOSIT in amount of 5.55 ethereums.</p>
<p>Here is their email response:</p>
