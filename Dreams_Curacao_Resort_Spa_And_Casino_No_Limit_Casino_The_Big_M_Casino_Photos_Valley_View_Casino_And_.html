    <h1>Dreams Curacao Resort Spa And Casino No Limit Casino The Big M Casino Photos Valley View Casino And</h1>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I'm feeling a bit unfairly treated and unjustly handled... it might even be a case of unfair competition. Now, I know many of you don't think much of bonuses, but that's not my issue here... I've been registered at many casinos for quite a while now, and this has never happened at any of them. Usually, there are bonus codes available through social networks like Telegram, Whatsapp Messenger, etc., from either them or their affiliates, each with different good values.. But that's not what this is about... Here, I've always used and it works well with all the others, namely through Telegram AI "Casino Promo Bot", mostly for (ggbet, ice casino, vulkanvegas, verdecasino) with all the others, for example, no problems and for verde, the advertised codes were invitingly good (177%+70fs for min10€ deposit) (225%+75fs for min15€ deposit). For the former, I used a code the day before yesterday, the bonus at verde generated as usual as it is accepted by the code, activated, deposited and no bonus (always disappeared as if used up) but no bonus received. Upon enquiry via online chat and their verification, the answer (erroneously) was that I had deposited the wrong amount, it shouldn't have been 10€ but 35€.</p>
<p>But in such a mistake, the bonus wouldn't just dissolve from the active deals. Afterwards, following my clarification, they said it was only for first-time registrants. I was upset and left.. much much later yesterday I entered another code, activated it, but first got approval from the online chat as to whether this super cool bonus was real and would work. Their answer was to just deposit and go... I wanted to use the bonus tonight, I deposited, no bonus. Another chat liner says hang on.. checks and says it was only for first deposit... but nowhere... nowhere does it point it out... and I also had my confirmation that everything should be fine with it. Now isn't this just unfair competition... extremely unfair... I would have definitely chosen elsewhere with my deposit. And whether one can finalize the bonus or not would anyway still be in the stars. But at least it’s an additional chance.. and fun... and in this way, it's just fraud on customers..</p>
<p>Chat logs could be attached as well but.</p>
