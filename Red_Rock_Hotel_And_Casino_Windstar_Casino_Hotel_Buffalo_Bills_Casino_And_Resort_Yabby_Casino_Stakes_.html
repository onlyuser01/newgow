<p>Virtual sports reality operator SimWin Sports continued to add industry experience to its ranks with the appointment of Paul Johnson to its advisory board.</p>
<p>Advising on Future Growth Efforts</p>
<p>The addition of Johnson to the advisory board of SimWin Sports brings over 20 years of sports industry experience to the team at the virtual sports reality operator. In his new role, Johnson will be providing advice in the areas of sales, digital media, international broadcasting, and streaming.</p>
<p>“I am ecstatic to join my colleagues and longtime business partners, David Ortiz and Tom Goedde, in this new and exciting venture,” Johnson commented, delighted at the opportunity to join SimWin Sports at a key moment for the business and the company’s growth strategy.</p>
<p>Johnson was instrumental in the development of the PGA Tour, having served on the tour’s executive committee for eight years. In his 20 years with the PGA, he leveraged his leadership skills to help the Tour expand its digital footprint.</p>
<p>“My experience with all facets of sports, digital media, esports and creating new business growth will be instrumental to continuing to kickstart SimWin’s growth,” Johnson continued, looking forward to “advising the team to help SimWin shape its business and build strong partnerships to accelerate growth.”</p>
<p>Johnson, who is also the founder and CEO of Orion Business Advisors, an advisory firm focusing on growing sports and esports businesses by leveraging knowledge, experience and networks, was welcomed to the advisory board by SimWin Sports founder and CEO David Ortiz.</p>
<p>Extensive Network and Industry Accolades</p>
<p>On behalf of the company, Ortiz said that Johnson is a very familiar face to SimWim as he has worked with several of the virtual reality operator’s executives in the past, hailing his credentials for the role.</p>
<p>“Paul’s extensive network and accolades in the industry are simply remarkable; and we are thrilled to have him join our incredibly senior team of advisors to enhance further our digital media, international broadcast, and streaming assets, as well as to increase future team sales,” Ortiz concluded.</p>
<p>Johnson is the latest addition to the board at SimWin Sports following in the footsteps of Jamie Shea who joined as a non-executive director in October.</p>
<p>Boasting more than three decades of betting industry experience gained at industry leaders such as Hard Rock, Caesars Entertainment, Carnival, IGT, and DraftKings, Shea joined SimWin Sports and was charged with oversight of the company’s business across all verticals.</p>
