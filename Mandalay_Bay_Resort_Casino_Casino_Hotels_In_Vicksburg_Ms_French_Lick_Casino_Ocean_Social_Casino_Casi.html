    <h1>Mandalay Bay Resort Casino Casino Hotels In Vicksburg Ms French Lick Casino Ocean Social Casino Casi</h1>

<p>On May 29th approx 3:44 am I was given an operator bonus of $50.00. that put my account to 50.05. This operator bonus was for master card incentives. it states right on there cashiers page, Get an extra 15% when you deposit with your Mastercard or American Express. Well it never does this automatically so you have to ask for it. I dont ask everytime. I let it build a bit then ask an operator, and they have always been cool about it. That night he was cool about it and asked me if 50 bucks free play was ok? I said great , thank you, nite. A friend, Devin, was with me through this whole evening. We sat here in front of the computer, playing numerous different slots, hitting different small jackpots. The same night about 4:50 am I was playing Reef Encounter. I hit a jackpot $3097.40. Nothing huge. I was happy. After this and winning small amounts here and there, my account was at 3287.73. It was about 5am in the morning. I then immediately checked to see what the play thru was. I believe it was 3 or 4000 bucks, and i kept on playing to meet the play thru. After meeting the play through It still would not let me withdrawl money. So I went back to speak with the operator, the same one that gave me the 50 to begin with. he told me to go to cashier and forfeit the 50 bonus. Then I would be able to withdrawl that money. Sure enough, i withdrew 3200 . that was on the 29th. On the 31st I noticed that on my statement it said withdrawl, 2200 mistake. I thought mothing of this. then after 10 days I began to wonder. You see they did deposit 960. they took 40 out for trsanfer fee. Any other time its only 20. They told me to check with my bank. Nope, my bank took no money. On the 9th I decided to get online and talk with them about this. I spoke with 3 people that night. The first guy blew me off, stating if it wasnt in my account within 24 hours to contact them for a manual withdrawl. The second guy, Paul... told me that the rules state, max cash out with a match bonus is 1000 bucks. But I DIDNT use a match bonus. I never do, just for this reason. But before I could say anything he put me on hold and never came back. The last person I had help me was Paige. She was nice and patient at first. As the conversation went longer and longer, she got actaully impatient... and kind of sarcastic. She went in and looked. came back 5 minutes later and started questioning me. Like something was my fault. I asked her numerous times who can I call back tomorrow and speak with about this. Everytime she ignored my request. at the end she said, this is how financial is dealing with this situation. Its a match bonus, therefore you get no more money. I again said, :et me talk to finacial. She replied with they dont speak with players. At this point I said I will figure out what to do, there must be other ways to put a complaint out there about a casino. There are other avenues I can take. She came back with such as?? I have a copy of all the messages from this night. from all 3 of the operators. What they have done is wrong. They lied to keep from cashing out my money and that is wrong. I can send you copies of all conversations plus a copy of my account. Please help</p>
