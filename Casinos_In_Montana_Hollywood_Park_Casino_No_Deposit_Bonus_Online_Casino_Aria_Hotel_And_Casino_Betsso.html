<p>Pariplay, an aggregator and supplier of iGaming content, has struck a new pivotal partnership with the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. The company has welcomed the opportunity to become an official authorized supplier in the Keystone State and has expanded on what is already a growing number of B2B licenses in crucial iGaming jurisdictions across the United States, including New Jersey, West Virginia, and Michigan.</p>
<p>New Opportunities Loom with Pennsylvania Entry</p>
<p>The development has been welcomed by Pariplay head of compliance Lawrence Hanlin who saw in this new license acquisition the opportunity to further scale the company’s product reach and consolidate Pariplay’s status as a leader in the space insofar as the execution and delivery of iGaming content goes. Hanlin said:</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on working extremely hard to study the regulations and compliance to enter markets swiftly and seamlessly, and Pennsylvania is yet another example of that. Pariplay head of compliance Lawrence Hanlin</p>
<p>Hanlin continued by adding that the license would make it possible to serve an ever-growing number of partners and operators, as well as their players, and provide locally appealing content. Pennsylvania is one of the biggest iGaming markets in the United States, right alongside New Jersey, with more to follow.</p>
<p>Pariplay will be in a position to deliver in-house games developed by Wizard Games but also leverage the thousands of readily available games from third parties through the Fusion platform, an aggregation content distribution solution that Pariplay uses to provide players with the best possible experience.</p>
<p>Bringing the Content Operators and Players Want</p>
<p>Pariplay managing director Adrian Bailey said that the latest move into the new market was a reflection of the company’s commitment to growing its footprint consistently in the United States and emerging jurisdictions within the country.</p>
<p>“Receiving our fourth license in the US is an important landmark for us and we’re eager to expand commercially in our newest market. It is one that has great potential both for Pariplay and also our future partners,” Bailey noted.</p>
<p>Pariplay has been working hard to consolidate its footprint in iGaming, adding Caleta Gaming to its Fusion platform most recently. The company also signed a partnership with Topspin most recently.</p>
