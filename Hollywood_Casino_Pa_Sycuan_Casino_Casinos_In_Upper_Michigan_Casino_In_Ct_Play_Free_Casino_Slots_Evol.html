<p>Evolution continues to build upon its offer across the United States with the latest release targeting New Jersey. The live dealer game supplier has debuted its dedicated Lightning Roulette game in New Jersey, bringing its flagship product to one of the biggest markets in the US.</p>
<p>Lightning Roulette Is All Systems Go in New Jersey</p>
<p>Live Roulette is one of the latest products in the company’s portfolio. Released in 2018, the game introduced unique multiplier features that allow players to win 50x or 500x on their original bets, pushing their win potential up.</p>
<p>While the game offers a slightly less advantageous median house edge, it’s still considered one of the best versions of the live game there is. The combination of RNG mechanics and live “electrifying” experience has been Evolution’s sales pitch.</p>
<p>Lightning Roulette has needed little marketing though, as the game’s high-quality production and opportunities to win big have done most of the promoting over the past few years. Commenting on this release, Evolution commercial director for North America Jeff Millar said:</p>
<p>“We are delighted to launch Lightning Roulette in New Jersey and to be able to offer the game to our operators and their players in the state.” Evolution commercial director for North America Jeff Millar</p>
<p>Based on previous experience with the game, Millar is confident that Lightning Roulette will strike home with players in the state, helping them enjoy a fulfilling live gaming experience. He added that the unique concept of the game has allowed it to stand out from the competition and become a player-favorite option.</p>
<p>Unique Technology to Set the Game Apart</p>
<p>Millar added that the technology used in the studio realization of the game was “incredibly advanced” and that Evolution is seeking to bring this innovative product to all iGaming markets in the United States where the game has obtained the necessary approvals.</p>
<p>This version of roulette follows the launch of another Evolution title, Auto Lightning Roulette in New Jersey. Evolution has been on the market since 2006 and it established itself as the go-to authority on live games. It has been actively acquiring businesses to expand in other aspects of the industry.</p>
<p>Evolution’s most significant acquisition was the purchase of NetEnt, the world’s defining slot developer. Elsewhere in North America, Evolution introduced its products with the Ontario Lottery in Canada.</p>
