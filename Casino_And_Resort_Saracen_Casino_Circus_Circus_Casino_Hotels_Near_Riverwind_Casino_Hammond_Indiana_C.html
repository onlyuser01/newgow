<p>The investigation began on Oct. 11. That’s when police stopped a Land Rover with temporary tags on Paradise Road just before midnight, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Paradise Road runs behind the large casinos on the east side of the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>The traffic stop was at the Mardi Gras Hotel and Casino on Paradise Road, according to KLAS-TV.</p>
<p>A juvenile female was driving the Land Rover with two adults inside. Police said Trevor Carter, 49, was in the back seat. A 26-year-old woman was in the front passenger seat. Authorities later learned the juvenile was from California and was not related to the two adults.</p>
<p>Police said the three people that night had gone to local stores to buy a dress, high heels, liquor, and condoms.</p>
<p>‘Cowboy Buckles and Boots’</p>
<p>In early October, the young woman had been in Las Vegas on vacation with her family. During this trip, she came into contact with the 26-year-old woman. The woman told the juvenile she was pretty. The two exchanged information before the juvenile returned home, according to the television station.</p>
<p>The juvenile booked a flight to Las Vegas on Oct. 10 without her family. She contacted the woman. The adult took the juvenile to the Mardi Gras and got a room for her, the television station reported.</p>
<p>Police said Carter, known as Smiley, spoke with the juvenile about making money as a prostitute. The juvenile was instructed to charge $500 for each encounter. She also was told to look for men wearing “cowboy buckles and boots” as potential good customers.</p>
<p>The juvenile was advised to make her customers drink a shot of liquor to be sure the person was not an undercover officer, police said. She was instructed to give Carter whatever money she made.</p>
<p>After an investigation, police arrested Carter on Nov. 5. He is due in court in March on a charge of sex trafficking of a child under 18, records show.</p>
<p>Suspected Pimp Jailed</p>
<p>Carter’s arrest followed a recent unrelated allegation of prostitution on the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>On Oct. 7, Letorian Hunt was arrested after police heard a rap song he supposedly composed. The song indicated he had two “successful” prostitutes working for him, according to Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p>
<p>One woman was arrested on suspicion of working as a prostitute at the Cosmopolitan Casino on the Strip, a police report states.</p>
<p>Hunt was charged Oct. 29 with two counts of pandering and two counts of living from the earnings of a prostitute, court records show. Hunt has been released on bail. He is due in court on Jan. 12.</p>
<p>Before arresting Hunt, police monitored his social media accounts. He made several posts implying he was a pimp, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>Roses are red, violets are blue, if you come be my hoe you can be this fly to (sic),” one post reads.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the Cosmopolitan and other properties have beefed up in-house security in response to a wave of violence at different sites on the Strip.</p>
