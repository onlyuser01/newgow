    <h1>Chumba Casino The Orleans Hotel And Casino Restaurants In Circus Circus Casino Lumiere Casino Casino</h1>

<p>Hello, Nik, your answer is exactly like the ones I have received so far both from you and from Bizzo casino, .. nothing changes. anyway I will give you the last brief summary, at least I will try,., I am a customer in possession of an account, both of your National casino site, and Bizzo casino, .. not for a long time, but enough to make several deposits, both in one site, both in the other ,, I have also already withdrawn, once for each site .. we are talking about small sums ,, I was happy, until one day that while I was playing on my favorite slot, Book of tomb, suddenly he gives me a bonus of the books he opens them to me and gives me a small win, we are talking about 22 euros, but I realized that he had not even credited it to my credit, okay, from the game, I immediately go to chat I expose the problem but this whole mess started them .. It doesn't matter I lost I quit the game, but the next day I did another top up of my account, unfortunately I go back to the same slot, while I was winning again it freezes the slot, it makes me leave the game, I a little pissed off, when I came back I even had about 40 eur or on my real credit, and I realize that I am at zero, I went to chat, I tried to explain what had happened to me in the best possible way, I sent almost immediately, everything that was asked of me (the name of the slot, the 'now, my bet, credit before and after, I even took screenshots that showed what I was saying, but we never got out of this situation, on both sides, all this because according to gold I would have done for cheat what, to whom, .... I want to remind you that I am an honest customer who pays money and at least, I should rest assured that if I win a little something, it would be given to me ..... from these episodes I go out definitely with my head held high, because I am on the right side, but the problem is that you are untouchable, but surely I will not pay a cent more on both National and Bizzo, .. nobody has been able to watch with these phenomenal servers you have, to take a tour in my profile, enter where I want lete you, check that in fact I was honest and I told the truth, I do not deserve to be treated like a liar, okay I hope I was clear Mr. Nick, good evening.</p>
