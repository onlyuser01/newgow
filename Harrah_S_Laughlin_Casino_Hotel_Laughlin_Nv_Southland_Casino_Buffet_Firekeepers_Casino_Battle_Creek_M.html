    <h1>Harrah S Laughlin Casino Hotel Laughlin Nv Southland Casino Buffet Firekeepers Casino Battle Creek M</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I was playing on the CasinoFriday website and after the games, I made a complaint to them about a breach of license terms (Estonian license)</p>
<p>and requested part of my deposits back.</p>
<p>I received a reply from them that they are not under the jurisdiction of the Estonian license, but they have a Curacao license, the terms of which I agreed to when I created an account with them, so they claim my complaint is unfounded.</p>
<p>This came as quite a surprise to me as I went directly to their website through a link from the Estonian Tax and Customs Board's pages, and CasinoFriday's website has the Estonian Tax and Customs Board's logo, as well as Finnish text, which does not mention anything about a Curacao license. They only had the Estonian Tax and Customs Board's logo on their website, and the link underneath led to the Estonian Business Register.</p>
<p>In Finland, all their partners also advertise the Estonian license and tax-free winnings for CasinoFriday players.</p>
<p>Currently, the operator in question has modified their website to include the correct license.</p>
<p>Attached to this complaint are screenshots from before they changed their website. These show how they intentionally advertised a safer license to attract Finnish players.</p>
<p>The screenshots are public information, so they can be published.</p>
<p>In my opinion, they have seriously misled customers and Finnish players.</p>
