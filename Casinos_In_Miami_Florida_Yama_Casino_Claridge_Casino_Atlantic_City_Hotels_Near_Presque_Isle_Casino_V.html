<p>Gaming Corps, a Swedish developer of original casino games, has expanded its presence in the Ukrainian gaming market thanks to an agreement with Infingame, a local leader in content aggregation. The former company’s content will thus reach many companies in Infingame’s growing roster of partner operators.</p>
<p>As agreed, Gaming Corps will inject its entire portfolio of games into Infingame’s aggregation platform. As a result, Ukrainian gambling companies will be able to add many diverse games to their offerings.</p>
<p>Gaming Corps offers a rich selection of crash, mine, table and slot games. In addition to that, Gaming Corps is one of the few gambling providers to offer a certified Plinko to regulated markets, making its content very valuable to operators wishing to spice up their library.</p>
<p>Thanks to the integration, Ukrainian players will get to experience best-in-class titles such as Coin Miner, Coin Miner 2, Penalty Champion and Plinko. In addition, operators will be able to onboard Gaming Corps’ recently launched slot + mine game duo sets, like Raging Zeus and Raging Zeus Mines.</p>

<p>Representatives shared their thoughts on the new partnership. Infingame’s chief executive officer, Pavel Fedyushin, said that his team is committed to supplying operators with success-driving content that will help them grow and differentiate themselves from their competition.</p>
<p>As a result, Fedyushin is delighted to enhance Infingame’s platform with games from yet another leading iGaming provider.</p>
<p>We are pleased to welcome Gaming Corps aboard as they share our commitment to delivering the very best in casino entertainment, their complete range of content is now accessible in Infingame’s portfolio and can be easily integrated into any online casino platform through a single, seamless API session.
