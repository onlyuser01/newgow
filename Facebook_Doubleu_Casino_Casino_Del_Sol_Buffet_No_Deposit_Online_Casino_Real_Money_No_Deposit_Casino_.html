    <h1>Facebook Doubleu Casino Casino Del Sol Buffet No Deposit Online Casino Real Money No Deposit Casino</h1>

<p>I'm fully aware of how long it takes for complaints to be fully resolved by these purposefully slow and the typical delay tactics used by legal and illegal casinos.</p>
<p>However my issue is the fact I submitted a complaint on here eager and waiting for somebody to quickly scan over my very (non-complicated) complaint, which by the way would take no longer than 2 minutes for the complaint to go from 'submitted' to 'case opened' and a quick note asking for what other information is possibly required by Casino Guru. I was sat here waiting with any documents to get things moving.</p>
<p>If Casino Guru have enough staff to immediately respond to forum threads (which in most cases should not be a priority) then they should be able to quickly open up new casino complaints especially non-complicated ones. I am aware staff work on here during the evenings including Sunday, plus the whole of Monday without a single bit of movement yet staff quickly responded to forum questions.</p>
<p>No wonder the UK Government are coming down strict on casinos these days, because players are well and truly sick of the way we are being treated. We are taken for mugs and these constant delay tactics used by casinos are truly astounding.</p>
<p>Wait days for Casino Guru to look at a complaint</p>
<p>Wait up to 9 weeks for Gam-Stop to respond to simple emails</p>
<p>Wait up to 8 weeks for legal casinos to respond to even the most basic and simple complaints</p>
<p>Thousands of dodgy casinos opening up daily with problem gamblers spending everything they have, yet the authorities and banks turn a blind eye with no enforcement action.</p>
<p>Even the UK Gambling Commission take up to 3 months to answer a simple email.</p>
<p>Oh and by the way this has been going on for years well before this plandemic.</p>
