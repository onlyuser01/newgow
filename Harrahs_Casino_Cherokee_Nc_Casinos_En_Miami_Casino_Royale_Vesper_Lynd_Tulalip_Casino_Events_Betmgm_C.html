<p>The International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA), the leading global voice on integrity for the licensed betting industry, has released its 2023 sports betting integrity report. The organization notably said that the number of suspicious sports betting alerts has decreased significantly.</p>
<p>According to the IBIA, a total of 184 alerts were reported in 2023, representing a year-on-year decrease of 101, or 35%. For reference, a total of 285 alerts were recorded in 2022. Moreover, the IBIA pointed out that between 2019 and 2022, the annual average number of alerts was 244.</p>
<p>In addition to recording 184 alerts, the IBIA’s suspicious betting activity data proved that 74 matches were corrupted. Luckily, the body was thus able to report an increase in the number of sanctioned violators.</p>
<p>The IBIA noted that its ability to recognize and deter suspicious betting activity has increased dramatically in recent years. The organization now comprises gambling companies responsible for more than $137 billion of annual global betting turnover.</p>
<p>In addition to demonstrating the improved IBIA capabilities, the latest figures also highlight the importance of requiring sports betting operators to join an international integrity monitoring body. The integrity specialist cited Brazil’s new rules as a perfect example.</p>
<p>IBIA’s chief executive officer, Khalid Ali, commented on the latest figures, describing them as “encouraging.” According to him, they demonstrate that his organization’s monitoring and alert network is truly making a difference.</p>
<p>Despite this progress, we must remain vigilant and recognize that the greatest threat to sports integrity comes from unregulated operators, most notably in Asia. Khalid Ali, CEO, IBIA</p>
<p>Soccer and Tennis Were the Most Reported Sports</p>
<p>In the meantime, the IBIA confirmed that its alerts led to the successful sanctioning of 21 clubs, players and officials – a substantial increase from 2022’s 15. The sanctioned people in 2023 included 8 tennis athletes, 7 umpires and 4 snooker players.</p>
<p>Despite the high number of sanctioned tennis players, soccer was the sport with the majority of alerts with 63. This number is more or less in line with those reported in 2022 and 2021 when the IBIA reported 67 and 66 soccer-related alerts, respectively.</p>
<p>Tennis was the second most reported sport with 54 alerts. This figure notably represents a stellar 49% decrease on the 2022 total of 206.</p>
<p>Mr Ali praised the decrease in tennis alerts. He added that the IBIA will continue to work closely with the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) and other important tennis organizations to continue prosecuting wrongdoers. Ali concluded that the strict sanctions imposed on recent violators have proven effective in discouraging fraud.</p>
