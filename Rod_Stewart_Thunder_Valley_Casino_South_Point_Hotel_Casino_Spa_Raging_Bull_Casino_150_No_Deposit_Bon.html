<p>Hard Rock International, a British-based multinational chain of restaurants, resorts and casinos, is currently building a new casino in Rockford, Illinois. Although the new project is yet to be completed, Hard Rock is already doing its best to benefit the local community.</p>
<p>Hard Rock Supports the Rockford Promise</p>
<p>Hard Rock announced that it would be providing funding to the Rockford Promise, a local charity that provides scholarships to local students. This move is Hard Rock’s bid to gain the locals’ trust ahead of the completion of its Rockford Hard Rock Casino project.</p>
<p>The Rockford Promise program provides full-tuition scholarships to deserving graduates of Rockford Public School District 205. The program is designed to mirror other Promise programs across the United States and aims to boost educational attainment in the community. The scholarship, according to the charity, is a “powerful economic incentive for residents and businesses to locate in the Rockford region.”</p>
<p>The non-profit organization has existing partnerships with Rock Valley, Rockford University and Northern Illinois University. More information can be found on the charity’s site.</p>
<p>Many Acknowledged Hard Rock’s Contribution</p>
<p>Kaylene Groh, the executive director of Rockford Promise, reaffirmed that the company’s goal is to support local students. Groh added that Hard Rock’s investment will make it easier for the non-profit to incentivize students in the community.</p>
<p>Northern Illinois University’s VP of enrollment Sol Jensen also approved of Hard Rock’s initiative. He noted that the establishment will welcome 133 new freshmen as opposed to two years ago when it welcomed no more than 30 students. These numbers show that the Rockford Promise’s scholarship program is having a profound effect on the community. Because of that, Jensen praised the casino company for supporting local education.</p>
<p>Hard Rock’s funding was welcomed by local authorities as well. Mayor Tom McNamara shared that he believes the new casino will be more than a novelty. According to him, the new venue will enhance the lives of many people in Rockford. He noted that Rockford Hard Rock Casino is a project that will not only benefit investors but the overall community as well.</p>
<p>In other news, Hard Rock’s sports betting division, Hard Rock Sportsbook, inked a new agreement with the sports data specialist Sportradar. This will provide Hard Rock customers with a wide range of different sports betting options from various leagues worldwide.</p>
