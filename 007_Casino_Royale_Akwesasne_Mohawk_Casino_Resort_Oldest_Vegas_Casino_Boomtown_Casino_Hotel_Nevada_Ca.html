<p>After an initial pushback from national leagues, the main sporting bodies around the world are readily accepting partnerships with betting operators. A similar move is undertaken by bookmakers seeking to consolidate their clout in emerging markets while relying on data-driven solutions. Sportsradar has just managed to secure an important deal.</p>
<p>Sportsradar Becomes Official Data Provider for Betting</p>
<p>Sportsradar will now be joining the MGM GVC Interactive joint venture, allowing the company to leverage its expertise as a big data analyst and help the business develop by using reliable sports betting data for the entire market in the United States.</p>

<p>As per the specifics of the deal, Sportsradar will provide valuable insight in both pre-match and live betting situations across the flagship sporting events and leagues in the country. Sportsradar presently has vast troves of information for the NBA, NHL, and NFL, along with MLB and NASCAR.</p>
<p>The company has agreed to assist GVC and MGM Resorts with their new venture, which will supposedly take over the entire US market with the initial investment going all the way up to $200 million. Each company invested $100 million earlier this year to kickstart the new facility.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, the companies will seek to penetrate every aspect of the iGaming and betting industry in the United States, starting with what will be their flagship product – sports betting, and then moving to anything in-between, including online real money, social casinos, online poker, and any land-based events focused on competitive play.</p>
<p>Both companies have been quite satisfied with the partnership and put great store by the future development of the industry. Similarly, Sportsradar Gaming Sales VP Neale Deeley expressed a similarly positive sentiment about the inked partnership with the new joint venture.</p>
<p>We have been preparing for the opening of the US market for some time now with an across the board ramp up of our US sports betting offering and we are delighted with this endorsement from MGM and GVC that all the hard work is delivering what world class betting operators are looking for.</p>
<p>Mr. Deeley pointed out that his company was leaders in the US market and they were proud to become the official supplier of valuable data. In his opinion, the deal with the new joint venture was a confirmation about all the hard work that Sportsradar has done so far.</p>
<p>Upbeat about the Future</p>
<p>Apart from the specific products outlined above, Sportsradar will also deliver “bet stimulation content”, such as live match trackers. MGM GVC CEO Adam Greenblatt also expressed his satisfaction with the most recent developments.</p>
<p>He said that the venture had a simple objective – to provide customers in the US with the best range of products they can utilize. With this in mind, Mr. Greenblatt said that Sportsradar is the right partner for the company as it would allow it to reach every sporting event on the US market, citing the company’s substantial global portfolio.</p>
<p>At the end of October, MGM announced its first gaming partnership with the National Football League (NFL) indicating lenience in the anti-gambling and betting stance among mainstream sporting bodies.</p>
