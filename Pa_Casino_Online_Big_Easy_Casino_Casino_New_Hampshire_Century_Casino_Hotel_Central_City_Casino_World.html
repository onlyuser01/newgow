<p>The NOVOMATIC interactive division and leading omnichannel technology provider for the online and land-based gambling sector, Greentube, expanded its US-facing presence after securing a new license. On Thursday, the company revealed it secured an Online Gaming Service Provider license from the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection.</p>
<p>This license marks a major step in Greentube's growth as it allows the supplier to sign partnerships with operators in the state. Moreover, the license further boosts the presence of the company within the United States, after previously introducing its services to major markets such as Michigan and New Jersey. This marks Greentube's third US-facing license as the company continues to expand further its reach.</p>
<p>The license in the Constitution State clears the company to introduce its leading portfolio of content for gambling operators. As a result, operators will be able to enjoy leading games such as Diamond Cash: Mighty Sevens, Diamond Cash: Oasis Riches, Diamond Cash: Mighty Elephant and Diamond Cash: Mighty Emperor. Among those titles, Greentube confirmed it is planning to soon introduce games specifically developed for US players.</p>
<p>In a statement released on February 2, 2023, Greentube's CFO/CGO, Michael Bauer, shared his excitement saying: "North America continues to be a key region for us and in gaining a third US state license, we have achieved an important step in our growth journey."</p>
<p>He pointed out that the US represents a unique opportunity for the betting vertical, especially considering the localization options that can cater to the players in different jurisdictions. Bauer predicted that Greentube is positioned well for further growth in the US by offering premium games. Finally, he said: "We are looking forward to teaming up with operators in Connecticut and can't wait to see how players in the state react to our portfolio."</p>
<p>Currently, less than ten states offer legal online gambling entertainment. On the other hand, more than 30 US states offer some form of sports betting. But Connecticut offers both sports betting and online casino gambling. In fact, recently released data reveals that the state's online sports betting and iGaming market has significant potential.</p>
<p>Figures released by the gambling regulator for December 2022 reveal that the market hit a record level. Overall, iGaming wagers in December hit $1.16 billion, marking the first time Connecticut operators surpassed the billion-dollar mark.</p>
<p>Greentube's entry in Connecticut comes after only recently, the company secured a majority shareholding in Altaetec, a leading iGaming management systems provider. Back in mid-January, the company acquired a controlling share in Altaetec, expanding further its technology capabilities for its B2B operations.</p>
