<p>Digital sports media group Better Collective unveiled Thursday it plans to make changes to its Board of Directors. The company revealed that its nomination committee proposed the appointment of industry experts René Rechtman and Britt Boeskov as members of the Board. A decision regarding the nominations is expected to be taken at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of the company scheduled to take place this August.</p>
<p>The appointments come after an extensive review process which uncovered that duo holds the necessary competencies to become a part of Better Collective’s Board. The newly proposed Board members have extensive experience within the media vertical and the sports betting sector, making them a perfect fit for the roles.</p>
<p>Rechtman brings more than two decades of experience in entertainment, technology and media. Throughout his extensive career, he held strategic senior-level roles with AOL, as well as the Walt Disney Company. Moreover, Rechtman is famous as the CEO and co-founder of the global entertainment company, Moonbug Entertainment, which is popular with its “CocoMelon” children’s show. The show is globally recognized and currently has more than 158 billion views on YouTube.</p>
<p>Boeskov has a significant professional experience within the sports betting vertical spanning more than 20 years. Throughout her career, she held different leadership roles and helped oversee the transformation and growth of international companies. Previously, Boeskov served as SVP of group strategy and execution at Better Collective until September 2022 when she transitioned to a consultancy role. Her professional background includes nearly two decades with the globally-recognized gaming giant Kindred.</p>
<p>The Nominees Bring Extensive Experience</p>
<p>Jens Bager, chair of the Board at Better Collective was excited to see the nomination of two experts that will bring knowledge and insight. “With our recently established vision to become the leading digital sports media group, it is crucial that we add media competencies at the board level and strengthen the transformation processes to reach our goal,” he explained. Additionally, Bager spoke about the extensive experience Rechtman and Boeskov bring that encompasses multiple verticals.</p>
<p>“I am very pleased and proud that we are able to attract these high profile and experienced candidates to the Better Collective board.“ Jens Bager, chair of the Board at Better Collective</p>
<p>Besides the nomination of Boeskov and Rechtman, the company confirmed that its Board member, Klaus Holse, unveiled his plans to step down from that role. Still, Better Collective explained that he will retain his current role through the EGM.</p>
<p>Given that the nomination of Boeskov and Rechtman is approved, the company’s board would expand from six to seven members. Better Collective vowed to share additional information about the upcoming EGM early in July.</p>
