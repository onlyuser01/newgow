<p>Soft2Bet, a provider of sportsbook and casino platforms and solutions, has revealed that it has been given the official go-ahead by the Romanian gambling regulator and will now be an authorized partner to operators in the country that are looking to strengthen their technical expertise and expand. The expansion follows a partnership with SlotMatrix that allows Sof2Bet to provide partner operators with cutting-edge and player-favorite games.</p>
<p>The license will allow the company to service a brand new market that has been one of Europe’s fastest developing over the past several months and years. The first-class license granted by the National Gambling Office (ONJN), allows the company to introduce games of chance to future partners in the country.</p>
<p>Commenting on this launch, Soft2Bet General Counsel David Yatom said: "We consider the Romanian market as one of the pivotal markets for establishing our foothold in Eastern Europe. Acquiring a local Romanian operating license marks an important step in our strategic expansion, building upon Soft2Bet’s success in other European markets. Stay tuned for more exciting developments in the near future."</p>
<p>Soft2Bet has been committed to perpetuating and extending its regional footprint in the European Union in particular. The supplier wishes to cater to broader demographics and believes that Romania presents it with this unique opportunity. Soft2Bet has hailed the regulatory regime in the country, arguing that it provides companies and businesses with a clear path to follow when deploying their products.</p>
<p>This is not the only success Soft2Bet has to report over the past month either. The company also managed to obtain a license in Sweden under the country’s reregulated iGaming regime, and it similarly expanded in Greece. In each of these instances, Soft2Bet is seeking to be a permanent fixture of Europe’s biggest and most lucrative iGaming markets.</p>
<p>Soft2Bet is not the only company to have secured an important distinction in the Romanian iGaming market this week either. ELA Games has also confirmed that it has received licensure from the ONJN and will be moving forward in the dynamic market.</p>
<p>Similar to Soft2Bet, ELA Games welcomed the opportunity and said the company was proud of the effort its team members have put in to make this happen. The supplier added that it was looking forward to bringing its best content to players and partner operators.</p>
