<p>Maine’s sports gambling industry has been led by the federally recognized tribes locally and it may be expanding before long. As online sports gambling is actually allowed in the Pine Tree State, other forms soon follow suit, although not necessarily. Many sportsbooks launched operations in November 2023 and extended their offers online.</p>
<p>Windfall from sports gambling has emboldened legislators to entertain the idea of expanding gambling to other online verticals, such as casinos and poker, a little more seriously. Most people seem to be happy with the idea of local tribes, who already have proven good service and infrastructural capacity, to also take charge of that as well.</p>
<p>To get there, though, a measure like that would have to clear the legislature and then deal with Gov. Janet Mills, who has been a rather outspoken critic of gambling. Mills has already shown opposition to gambling expansion once in the past although it was under her watch that online gambling launched in the state – the governor was bucking to popular demand at the time.</p>
<p>Now, though, a bill penned by Rep. Laura Supica and backed by a fair number of Democrats, including the House Speaker, Rachel Talbot Ross, seems to have found hold. Bipartisan support is doubly important when looking to placate a gung-ho governor who is openly against the proposed gambling expansion, but it is hardly all it takes to change a governor’s mind either.</p>
<p>So, what does LD 1777 suggest? The bill wants to do some good too and hopes to achieve that by curtailing some of lawmakers’ access to the money that is coming from gambling. Rather, the new bill would prefer to have the money fixed and divvied up, causing less friction as well on a legislative level in the future.</p>
<p>Tribes are unlikely to object either, as they will get exclusivity under the draft, which is something they have been all for. However, not all see eye-to-eye. Maine Gambling Control Board chairman Steve Silver believes that private operators beyond tribes should also be allowed to enter the competition for market share.</p>
<p>Although the commission only enforces rules, Silver seems to have a point, citing evidence from other markets that have repeatedly done better by inviting open competition. He is confident, though, that the idea of legalizing online gambling is to the benefit of the state, but under terms that he calls open and free-market.</p>
