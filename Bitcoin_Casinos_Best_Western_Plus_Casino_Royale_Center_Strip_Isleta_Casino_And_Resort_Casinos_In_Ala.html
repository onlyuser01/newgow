    <h1>Bitcoin Casinos Best Western Plus Casino Royale Center Strip Isleta Casino And Resort Casinos In Ala</h1>

<p>Manufacturer of video games and consumer electronics Atari announced today the company entered into partnership with the Litecoin Foundation, to help facilitate the use of Litecoin across its gaming platforms, as well as with other potential ventures, including joint merchandising.</p>
<p>The Litecoin Foundation is a non-profit organization with the main purpose to promote awareness of the decentralized cryptocurrency Litecoin, as well as highlighting its advantages to encourage its wider use. Litecoin is a fully secure peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that enables instant payments with almost zero costs to any location around the world, without needing a third party.</p>
<p>Litecoin(s) into Atari Token(s)</p>
<p>Litecoin users will be given different options to use their coins through the Atari ecosystem, mainly by investing into the Atari Token, thus help boosting its popularity. The Atari Token that has recently been integrated into the Arkane Network gaming platform will have multiple uses, including purchases and tracking of digital assets, as well as being the preferred payment method in the Atari Casino.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to have Litecoin as a means of payment for the Atari Token sales. Litecoin’s ease-of-use and low transaction costs make it a perfect fit for use alongside the Atari Token and other projects.” Fred Chesnais, CEO, Atari.</p>
<p>Atari VCS PC/Console Hybrid</p>
<p>Besides using Litecoin to invest into the Atari Token, holders of the digital currency will be able to use it to buy at discounted price the much-anticipated new Atari VCS gaming console, that will allow for hundreds of modern and classic games to be played, video in 4K resolution streamed, but will also have the option for users to create and upload games and apps of their own.</p>
<p>“… The Litecoin Foundation is excited to see the possibilities a partnership like this can have for not only Litecoin and cryptocurrencies but also the gaming industry and lifelong fans of Atari.” Charlie Lee, Managing Director, Litecoin Foundation</p>
<p>Digital Casino, Pong Token</p>
<p>Atari’s cryptocurrency casino will offer the company’s most famous games, among which Rollercoaster Tycoon, Missile Command, Asteroids and Centipede, names that are relatively unknown to the contemporary gamer. The casino will be run by Atari’s partner, ICICB, being granted a non-exclusive license, but profits from the casino operations will be equally split between the two parties.</p>
<p>The Atari Token is not the only coin the manufacturer intends on implementing into its ecosystem. Attracted by the possibilities presented by the block-chain technology, Atari Group recently announced it would launch its Pong Token, named after one of its popular games dating back to the first days of the company. The Pong Token will be used for local applications in Kenya related to the company’s operator license there.</p>
