<p>The reels are usually covered with jugs, mugs and pitchers, but each of these can be converted into a golden coin bringing in various winnings to the player. Commenting on the success of the franchise, NetEnt Director of Games Bryan Upton had this to say:</p>
<p>“Following the global success of Finn and the Swirly Spin™, the latest addition to the series is packed with even more player engaging, random features that capture the lively atmosphere of a traditional Irish tavern.</p>
<p>With incredible graphics and an action-packed gameplay, Finn’s Golden Tavern™ offers a wildly entertaining experience for all player type.”</p>
<p>When Tempers Fray, Finn Slams the Table</p>
<p>Two of the highlights in the game include the Free Spins Chest, which, once it reaches the center of the grid, will turn the regular symbols – designed as various mugs, jugs and pitchers – into coins, which pay a whole lot more.</p>
<p>You also stand a chance to unlock the free spins level will begin, introducing 5 free games for you to enjoy! There are also the avalanche reels, which will clear up winning combinations and replace any missing pieces with new ones.</p>
<p>Not least of all, players will enjoy a multiplier, which will start at x1 and scale up for each wild symbol during avalanche reels.</p>
<p>And since Finn’s a high-strung leprechaun, he will, on occasion, slam the table with his fist, and help you along to form new and winning combinations on the spot. The golden coin symbols, will have value varying between 5, 10 and 50 and they offer great options to top up players’ bankroll.</p>
<p>Online casinos already feature Finn’s Golden Tavern online slot as part of their portfolio and players are welcome to have a go at the game themselves.</p>
