    <h1>Santan Casino Buffalo Thunder Casino Chumba Casino Phone Number Bitcoin Casinos Usa Skydream Casino</h1>

<p>Dear Oleg,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Casino Guru and letting us help you with your issue. If I understand you correctly, you played with the €300 free chip welcome bonus; is that correct? I read the casino T&amp;Cs and couldn’t find any restrictions regarding payments to Germany, so I contacted the live chat support. They tried to persuade me they had the following term in their Bonus T&amp;Cs:</p>
<p>"Based on your country of residence, limitations apply to playing at the Casino, using bonuses, redemption of chips that are free or deposits via credit card. Carefully review the constraints that will apply. The complete list for restricted countries is: Australia, Algeria, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Belize, Costa Rica, Curacao, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Iraq, Iran, Malaysia, Myanmar, North Korea, New Zealand, Poland, Syria, Turkey, Ukraine, middle eastern countries and Asia. Customers from banned countries will not be entertained in any manner. Please consult customer service for the up to date banned country list."</p>
<p>I again went through the Bonus T&amp;Cs thoroughly but couldn’t find this rule. I asked the support for a screenshot that would prove it was visible on the website, but they failed to send it and were eager to finish the conversation. If the casino offers bonuses, the rules should be displayed for the players to see.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I found the following rule:</p>
<p>"The maximum withdrawal amount for any free chip given is 2x the value of the free chip. For example if you are given a $100 free chip and request a withdrawal amount of $500, you will only be approved for $200."</p>
<p>In your case, this means that the maximum you should be able to cash out from the €300 free chip is €600. If you agree, I would like to contact the casino to find a solution to the issue.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Peter</p>
