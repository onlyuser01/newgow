<p>Master Chen's Fortune review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>The fortune in the title of Master Chen’s Fortune appears to consist largely of those waving cat clocks and oranges. While he does appear to have stashed some coin in the odd vase and literal money trees, the dominant imagery of Master Chen’s Fortune is, somewhat unusually, utter tat.</p>
<p>This is rather charming in its own way, and given the red and gold colour scheme of the slot, this could easily have just been another of the endless Chinese-style slots that all look so similar.</p>
<p>Paytable for MAster Chen's Fortune slot</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Despite the overused theme, the visuals in Master Chen’s Fortune are really rather good. They are simple and easy to read, but with enough detail and character to make them stand out.</p>
<p>The animations could be a little clearer but work well in conjunction with the win and spin sounds.</p>
<p>The music is a little bland and is made up of pseudo-Chinese elevator music that is best turned off in this case.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>The game is played on five reels with three rows each and 9 win lines.</p>
<p>One twist is that wins can run from left to right or the other way, but in each case they do have to start on the leftmost or rightmost spot on that win line.</p>
<p>There are no bonus features to spice up the play so players who opt to chase after Master Chen’s Fortune need to be prepared for some very samey gameplay.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols. It only appears on reels two, three and four, but will add a times two multiplier to any win that includes it.</p>
<p>The Scatter symbol plays more like an any way wins symbol than a traditional Scatter. It will pay out for three or more Scatters anywhere on consecutive reels starting either in the leftmost or rightmost reel.</p>
<p>There are no bonus games in Master Chen’s Fortune.</p>
<p>Win amount with Wild symbol is doubled</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.48%, a little over our yardstick for average of 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.09 up to a maximum of $/£/€45.0 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is low, which makes it a very poor match for our slot machine strategies. We like to maximise volatility where possible in our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>While Master Chen’s Fortune is a charming and simplified take of the oriental-style slot, it fails to get our recommendation largely due to its low volatility. This makes it useless as a match for our preferred strategies.</p>
<p>For those who are unfussed by the low volatility, this game may be a good match if you like slots with simplified gameplay and no bonus features.</p>
