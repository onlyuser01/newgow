    <h1>Casino Madison Wi Casino Palace Station Empire Casino Online Caesars Atlantic City Resort Casino Cas</h1>

<p>Golden Nugget Casino in Lake Charles has expanded its relationship with DraftKings after launching a retail sportsbook at the premises in November 2021. Louisiana will become the 17th state to offer the online sportsbook by DraftKings as the mobile betting services by the operator for eligible customers will be permitted on January 28, at 8 am CT.</p>
<p>DraftKings Mobile Betting Will Increase Accessibility</p>
<p>So far, bettors were able to wager on sports at the retail sportsbook, located in Golden Nugget Casino. The addition of the mobile sportsbook by DraftKings will increase the accessibility of punters in the Pelican State, who’ve become fond of placing bets on NFL teams, especially on Kansas City Chiefs, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Los Angeles Rams, and Dallas Cowboys.</p>
<p>Matt Calish, the president and co-founder of DraftKings North America, stated that DraftKings has had several developments. The first one was the retail sportsbook at the casino while the second was the DFS approval. He noted that the mobile betting launch is a huge milestone for the company, which is now live in 18 US states, 17 of which offer DraftKings’ online sportsbook and one state is retail-only.</p>
<p>Calish concluded by saying that even though bettors were already able to wager on sports at the retail sportsbook, accessibility and the overall betting experience will be enhanced thanks to the launch of online betting.</p>
<p>Ronnie Johns, the chairman of the Gaming Control Board of Louisiana, confirmed that the long-awaited mobile betting launch will go online on January 28 (Friday) at 8 am CT and noted that it will be huge.</p>
<p>Betting Volume Will Increase With the Launch of Online Sportsbooks</p>
<p>In November and December, Louisiana retail sportsbooks reported more than 67 million wagers. According to the Louisiana Gaming Control Board, sportsbook made $10.1 million in those two months. Thanks to the addition of mobile betting, the overall volume will likely increase in the state.</p>
<p>Caesars Sportsbook and BetMGM also confirmed that they will be ready for the launch. In a statement, the co-president of Caesars Digital, Eric Hession, said that this was an opportunity that the company was waiting for a long time and added that Caesars is confident that its app will offer Louisiana bettors the most competitive odds.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, BetMGM confirmed that it is as ready as it can be for the launch. Adam Greenblatt, the CEO of the company, stated that BetMGM is proud to be among the first operators that will launch in Louisiana.</p>
<p>So far, the Gaming Control Board issued 13 licenses for online sportsbooks. Louisiana has a 14th retail sportsbook, Paragon Casino in Marksville, but the casino isn’t regulated by the board. Additionally, retail kiosks, bars and restaurants could start accepting bets in the state in March.</p>
