<p>As a result, Evil Geniuses, one of the largest North American esports teams and organizations, will have Thunderpick as its Marquee Partner for all of the team’s Counter-Strike: Global Offensive teams. There are several three teams competing in the game, including EG Black, EG Gold, and EG Blue.</p>
<p>Evil Geniuses Set to Bring Improved Experiences for Fans</p>
<p>The collaboration also sees Thunderpick promoted as the Official Crypto Casino and Gambling Partner for the team. Although slightly controversial at first glance, this is not the first time cryptocurrency companies have partnered up with esports organizations.</p>
<p>The now-troubled FTX previously owned the naming rights to Team SoloMid, but this partnership has been since severed as the exchange was embroiled in a series of scandals involving the misuse of consumer funds.</p>
<p>The partnership with Thunderpick only covers the Counter-Strike teams, and it extends to the academy, female and men’s teams. Thunderpick has commented on this opportunity, arguing that it’s a chance for the company to support female esports.</p>
<p>The partnership may be construed as strange by some, as Thunderpick is a crypto gambling company that holds a Curacao license but it’s not licensed in the United States or North America, which could be at odds with the tightening regulatory landscape in the region.</p>
<p>Commenting on this new opportunity, Evil Geniuses head of global partnerships Leonard Edwards said that the company was looking to enhance the fan experience and hailed Thunderpick’s ongoing commitment to ensure a reliable betting environment, thus offering a new arm of engagement during events.</p>
<p>Evolving with Changing Consumer Preferences</p>
<p>“We look forward to the positive impact this partnership will have on our organization,” Edwards said. The opportunity was welcomed by Evil Geniuses CEO Nicole Lapointe Jameson who said that this partnership would help the two companies work together on creating innovative experiences for esports fans. She added:</p>
<p>“Thunderpick’s commitment to ensuring a reliable and inventive betting environment will offer a new arm of engagement during events.”</p>
<p>Esports has been gaining prominence in the United States. Earlier this year, lawmakers in Pennsylvania suggested that betting on electronic sports should be legal in the Keystone State. A similar sentiment has been expressed in New Jersey and Nevada, among other jurisdictions.</p>
