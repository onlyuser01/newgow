<p>Kiwi Lottery Winner Kept $33M Ticket in Sock Drawer</p>

<p>After striking it rich in an extraordinary lottery draw in New Zealand, a couple from Christchurch wrestled with the decision of how to handle their astonishing win. As they did, they apparently weren’t concerned about someone pilfering the NZ$33-million (US$20.7 million) ticket, as they simply left it tucked away in a drawer.</p>

<p>The couple, who are choosing to remain anonymous, expressed their astonishment after the Lotto win left them dumbfounded. The lottery draw took place on June 28, but they didn’t come forward until July 8.</p>
<p>They needed time to process the win, according to Lotto officials, and to get their affairs in order prior to charting their course ahead. Now that they’ve collected their winnings, they can let the fun begin.</p>
<p>Cashing In</p>
<p>A representative from Lotto NZ said in a statement that the couple, who only occasionally played the lottery, purchased the Powerball Dip, a random set of numbers, about a week prior to the high-stakes drawing. The wife confessed that due to her busy schedule following the draw, she never took the time to verify her ticket.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until late last Wednesday that she sat down to check the numbers. Her husband was already asleep, but not for much longer.</p>
<p>When she discovered that all of the numbers matched, she woke him up so he could double-check. He confirmed the combination of numbers and suddenly, sleep wasn’t an option.</p>
<p>Instead of hastily contacting the Lotto office to claim their prize, the couple decided to take a pragmatic approach. They wanted to discuss their options and determine the best way to use their new fortune.</p>
<p>They tossed the winning ticket into a sock drawer while they went about their daily routines. Fortunately, nothing happened to the tiny slip of paper, and after a week, they claimed their prize.</p>
<p>Last week, 1.4 million Kiwis played the lottery. This soaring interest surged when the news broke of the massive jackpot. Marking a milestone in 2023, this latest lottery win ranks as the ninth-highest Powerball victory of the year, according to Lotto NZ statistics.</p>
<p>Don’t Go Out Like Rodgers</p>
<p>There are plenty of examples of lottery winners who didn’t know how to manage their sudden windfalls, so the Kiwi couple is taking the right approach in wanting to lay out their plans. If only Callie Rodgers had done that 20 years ago.</p>
<p>In 2003, at only 16, Rodgers struck gold by winning the jackpot in a UK draw. This event made her the youngest lottery winner in the UK. But she didn’t handle the instant success very well.</p>
<p>Rodgers has apparently blown most, or all, of her £1.87-million (US$2.4 million) lottery. She was recently spotted shopping at Iceland, a controversial discount supermarket chain, according to the media outlet The Daily Mail.</p>
<p>She apparently spent almost all of her winnings on cosmetic surgery, gifts for friends and family, and shopping. Rodgers also reportedly developed an expensive drug habit that also cut into her winnings.</p>
<p>It also came to light in court that, at least for a while, she was receiving Universal Credit, a type of Social Security payment, even after winning the lottery. That hasn’t helped her financial situation, as a court ordered her to pay it all back in installments, which she’s still doing.</p>
<p>Take Note Before Powerball Draw</p>
<p>Winning the lottery doesn’t mean you can’t be smart if you win. Making a plan and seeking financial advice should be the first two steps once you land on a big lottery ticket.</p>
<p>The next US Powerball drawing, which takes place Monday night, will be one of the biggest in recent history. It has escalated to $650 million after Saturday’s $629.1-million jackpot didn’t find a winner.</p>
<p>That draw was the 34th straight draw without a winner. Powerball officials announced in a press release that the upcoming prize will rank as the ninth-most substantial jackpot in the history of the game. Additionally, it will stand as the second-largest prize awarded this year.</p>
