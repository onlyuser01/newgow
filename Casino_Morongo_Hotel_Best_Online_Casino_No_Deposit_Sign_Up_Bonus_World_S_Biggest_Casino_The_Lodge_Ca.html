<p>After scoring 70 points last weekend at home, the Miami Dolphins are traveling to Orchard Park to take on the Buffalo Bills in Week 4</p>
<p>Last weekend, the Miami Dolphins scored the most points in an NFL game since 1996, scoring very close to breaking the all-time record. In Week 4, however, they’re taking on one of the league’s best defenses. Plus, they’re playing against the Buffalo Bills on the road, which explains why Sean McDermott’s men are seen as three-point underdogs ahead of the October 1 game.</p>

<p>Miami Dolphins Hoping for Another High-Scoring Performance</p>
<p>Last weekend, the Miami Dolphins became only the third team in the history of the NFL to score 70 points. They did it against the Denver Broncos, a team that’s not too great defensively in 2023. Nevertheless, scoring so many points is proof of how good the offensive team of the Miami Dolphins is.</p>
<p>The Dolphins scored 10 TDs last night.</p>
<p>This doesn't happen very often.</p>

<p>Starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was brilliant in that game, throwing for four touchdowns. That’s no surprise, but what is kind of surprising is that his backup Mike White also scored one TD. Running backs Raheem Mostert and Devon Achane scored three and two rushing TDs, respectively. Achane also scored two receiving TDs that evening, while the other three were scored by Tyreek Hill, Chosen Anderson, and Mostert.</p>
<p>These guys have been fantastic against Denver at home, but will they do great on the road against Buffalo?</p>
<p>Buffalo Bills are Always Great at Home</p>
<p>The Bills are fantastic defensively, meaning that they should be able to do well against Miami’s offense. Sure, we’ll probably see the Dolphins score a couple of TDs, but it’s certain they won’t destroy the Bills in the same manner as the Broncos.</p>
<p>Plus, the Bills will probably score a lot in Week 4, the main reason being that they’re playing on home turf. At Highmark Stadium, these guys have all wins against Miami since 2016 when they lost after overtime.</p>
<p>Another reason why the boys from Buffalo are seen as favorites in the Week 4 game is that they’re motivated to win. The fact is that they haven’t been too impressive since the start of the 2023 season. However, winning on Sunday afternoon would get them back in the Super Bowl conversation.</p>
<p>Dolphins vs. Bills Prediction</p>
<p>The Bills look like the team that can stop the Dolphins hype. Sure, Miami’s offense is brilliant, but Buffalo’s defense has what it takes to stop them from scoring too many TDs. Then, there’s the Bills offense led by Josh Allen, which seems capable of scoring 30+ in Week 4.</p>
<p>Picks: Buffalo Bills to win and cover the spread; over to hit</p>
