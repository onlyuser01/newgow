<p>Independent casino review and rating team</p>
<p>Our casino reviews are conducted by an independent casino review team with more than 15 members, whose sole responsibility is collecting information about all casinos on the internet and evaluating them based on the collected data.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, our reviews of online casinos can remain impartial and provide great informational value, as our casino reviewers can focus solely on creating reliable reviews and nothing else.</p>
<p>Objective casino review methodology</p>
<p>The casino review team follows a data-driven methodology, according to which they gather the available information about each casino. The collected data is then used to calculate the casino's Safety Index.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of the factors considered in our casino reviews, which go into calculation of the Safety Index:</p>
<p>Casino size – The size of a casino, expressed as its revenues or its number of players, is one of the most important factors. The quality of many big casinos with big revenues has been proven by time and a large number of players. Additionally, their large revenues enable them to pay out big wins without any issues, while smaller sites can struggle because of their worse financial situation.</p>

Additionally, their large revenues enable them to pay out big wins without any issues, while smaller sites can struggle because of their worse financial situation. Complaints submitted by players – Players often complain publicly about online casinos that treat them in an unfair way or try to scam them. We take these complaints into account, deducting points from the casino's Safety Index for each justified unresolved complaint. Considered complaints include those from our own Complaint Resolution Center, but also complaints collected from other relevant websites.</p>

Unfair practices and rules – If we find that a casino has fundamentally unfair rules in their Terms and Conditions or treats players unfairly, we deduct points from its Safety Index. If there are any, the casino's unfair clauses and practices are listed in its detailed review, specifically in the 'Safety Index explained' part.</p>

If there are any, the casino's unfair clauses and practices are listed in its detailed review, specifically in the 'Safety Index explained' part. Positive qualities – In relatively rare cases, we also add points for some positive qualities, for example for having an established network of brick-and-mortar venues or going above and beyond in terms of resolving player complaints.</p>
<p>– In relatively rare cases, we also add points for some positive qualities, for example for having an established network of brick-and-mortar venues or going above and beyond in terms of resolving player complaints. Related casinos – Other casinos that have a relationship with the casino also influence its review. This influence can be either positive or negative, depending on relevant qualities of the related casinos, and its size depends on the strength of the relationship between casinos.</p>
<p>Note: You can read more about our casino review process in a dedicated article on how we review online casinos.</p>
<p>User feedback and reviews submitted by players</p>
<p>Unlike our expert reviews, the ones submitted by players come in many shapes and sizes. While there is only one Casino Guru review and rating for each casino in our database, some casinos have hundreds of user reviews that range from terrible to amazing.</p>
<p>When reviewing a casino, users can submit a rating on a five-point scale from Very negative to Very positive, which is very similar to a classic scale from one to five stars.</p>
<p>To make things easier, we calculate an overall User feedback score that ranges from Terrible to Excellent. This should get you an overview of the casino's qualities – as expressed by other player – and make it easier to compare the User feedback of two casinos. However, to get the full picture, we recommend reading the reviews and seeing what players like and dislike.</p>
<p>Note: We only calculate the User feedback score that have received at least 15 reviews from players. We have decided to do this, because we believe that a smaller number of reviews is too low of a sample to base any comprehensive score on, and we wanted to avoid portraying casinos with only a few reviews too positively or negatively.</p>
<p>Things to watch out for when reading user reviews</p>
<p>When reading user reviews and comparing the User feedback score, there are some things you should keep in mind, as they can skew the ratings in a positive or negative direction:</p>
<p>Many online casino players submit a negative review when they are angry with the casino , for example when they feel like they should be winning more than they are. There is a high number of negative reviews of many casinos because of this, which push their overall scores down.</p>
<p>, for example when they feel like they should be winning more than they are. There is a high number of negative reviews of many casinos because of this, which push their overall scores down. On the other hand, some casinos consider their User feedback score on Casino Guru important, which is why they try to improve it, for example by asking their players to submit a positive review. We are doing our best to detect this and account for it, but these practices may have a positive effect on the User feedback score of casinos that do it.</p>
<p>As you can see, these two effects generally work in opposite directions, so they may cancel out for some casinos, but they can affect the User feedback score of some, too. That said, with how we collect the reviews and work with them, we believe that our User feedback score will give you a good idea of how players view a specific casino.</p>
<p>Finding the best reviewed casino</p>
<p>When selecting a casino to play at, you can look at our expert reviews or on reviews submitted by players. Or, ideally, you can look at both.</p>
<p>There are casinos that have a high Safety Index calculated based on our review process and a low User feedback score, and vice versa. This is because our evaluators and casino players generally look at different things when reviewing and rating a casino.</p>
<p>Our reviews</p>
<p>Our casino reviewers focus on fairness and safety. We want to make sure that any casino we recommend will treat players well and create a fair environment for them, without any significant unfair rules or other negative qualities. Fairness and safety are the top priority for us.</p>
<p>User reviews</p>
<p>Players rate and review casinos based on their personal experience, which may have been both positive and negative. As each of us focuses on different aspects, some reviews may be based on whether we have won or lost, whether we have communicated with a nice or unpleasant customer support representative, or many other things.</p>
<p>This is why individual reviews tend to be all over the place, but they can give you a great overview of which positive or negative things players experience at a casino.</p>
<p>Therefore, the best thing to do is to choose a casino with a high Safety Index, which also has good user reviews that praise things you want from an online casino. If you find such casino, it should be a great fit for you.</p>
<p>Note: If you are new to online gambling in general, we recommend you read our article on how to choose an online casino, in which we go over factors you should consider in detail.</p>
<p>Emphasis on responsible and safe gambling</p>
<p>It is extremely important to approach online gambling in a safe and responsible way. To prevent falling victim to gambling addiction, we recommend you read our article on how to gamble safely. Our section about responsible gambling and problem gambling help also contains other helpful articles about gambling addiction and other related topics.</p>
<p>We have already started collecting information about responsible gambling options – such as self-exclusion, betting limits, reality checks, and more – available at individual online casinos. However, because of the vastness of our database, we do not have the data collected for all casino sites. Once we have it, we will include this information in our review of each casino.</p>
