    <h1>Tulalip Casino Christmas Lights Plaza Hotel Casino Hottest Casino In Vegas North Carolina Casino Hig</h1>

<p>Hello good,</p>
<p>I would like to request help, since I create an account on the CBET platform and when I try to withdraw my balance, it tells me that I have a "turnover" balance pending betting of more than 800 thousand Argentine pesos.</p>
<p>I have been playing for approximately 1 week and I deposited a little more than 500 dollars in several deposits (I deposited several times since I lost everything I deposited each time).</p>
<p>In this last deposit I was finally able to win some money playing roulette and I wanted to withdraw it (a little more than 300usd) but they won't let me because of this "turnover" that if we do the math today the dollar is worth approximately $530 ars. Therefore, those 500 dollars are about $265,000 ars, so I don't understand how I can have a turnover of more than $800,000 if the total amount of my deposits is insignificantly less than this.</p>
<p>I talked to the support of the site and they told me about the "turnover" and that in my account the automatic system probably detected "strange" behavior and for that reason each bet won was added to the "turnover", which does not make sense Since as I mentioned before, of all the times that I deposited money that were like more than 6 times, I lost the total deposit in all of them and just this last time I was able to win something and not even because I am recovering and counting the 500 usd that I won, I only recovered 300usd for which I am at -200, which is not suspicious at all.</p>
<p>I only play roulette, I played a bit of blackjack and there I lost absolutely everything, in roulette I was only able to win something now and I don't do anything strange, red or black, or dozens... what is strange about these bets?</p>
<p>Anyway, I would like you to help me solve this problem, because from what I have been reading in other posts, this casino does this very often and I really do not want to continue playing so that my turnover continues to increase, which is clearly What would happen if I keep playing with CBET.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
