<p>Speaking of Indian cricket, the Mehsana police recently busted an illegal fake cricket tournament that posed as an alternative to the IPL. The fraud attracted bets from Russian sports fans who thought the events were legitimate. Meanwhile, the England and Wales Cricket Board banned Ryan Davies for betting on sports. Davies used to struggle with gambling addiction for a few years, which helped him avoid a severe penalty.</p>
