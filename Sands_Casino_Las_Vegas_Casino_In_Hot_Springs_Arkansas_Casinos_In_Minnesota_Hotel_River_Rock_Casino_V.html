    <h1>Sands Casino Las Vegas Casino In Hot Springs Arkansas Casinos In Minnesota Hotel River Rock Casino V</h1>

<p>Dear Spessuki,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>I have checked the general bonus terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"6.5. The minimum amount for a withdrawal is currently 300 Euros. Withdrawal of winnings and bonuses from pre-deposit free bonus money is currently limited to a maximum of 150 Euros. Any winnings or bonuses beyond 150 Euros that have accumulated prior to your initial deposit will be removed at the time a withdrawal has been requested. In order to withdraw winnings generated from pre-deposited free bonus money, a player must perform a successful deposit.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>6.6. Withdrawals of winnings and bonuses from pre-deposit free bonus money may be limited to specific countries. Please make sure you have carefully read all applicable terms and conditions linked to any bonus scheme we may offer from time to time."</p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, that according to our Fair Gambling Codex https://casino.guru/fair-gambling-codex-for-casinos#win-limits, we consider imposed win limit to be unfair and predator, only when it’s applied to a real money game, however, we accept bonus T&amp;Cs that restrict the maximum cash out from a bonus play.</p>
<p>Please understand that it is nothing unusual to have a maximum cash out applied to any promotional winnings and to remove the bonus amount at the time of the withdrawal.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you have received any winnings?</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
