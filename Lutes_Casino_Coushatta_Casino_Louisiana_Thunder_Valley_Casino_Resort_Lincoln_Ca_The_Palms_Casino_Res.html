<p>The Great Lake State is seeing a lovely growth in its iGaming space participants, developers and providers, increasing competition and hopefully the quality of content, available to local players. The latest addition to the list is Intress Media – an affiliate marketing group.</p>
<p>Intress Media Latest Player in Town</p>
<p>Intress Media is an affiliate marketing digital agency that develops “websites, mobile applications, and all kinds of media assets for affiliate marketing in the field of iGaming.” It’s hitting the news cycle as the state of Michigan has finally approved its newest license for iGamingMI.com. This is the company’s latest product, designed to target Michiganders. It will be offering local gamers information about online casinos, that are active in the state. This is the latest step of Intress Media’s expansion plan for all the regulated states in launching iGaming portals.</p>
<p>Thanks to the provided license, this is going to be a Michigan-exclusive product, so Intress Media will only be collaborating with operators approved by the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB). Maryna Sokirko, an IM Co-Founder said that “While our short-term objective is launching projects in other regulated states, building a true, safe community of gamblers remains our ultimate goal.” This is part of the company’s efforts to provide a safer and more “friendly gambling community,” and as Ms. Sokirko put it: “Responsible gaming was a key watchword when Michigan chose to license and regulate online gaming and it’s also a key driver behind what we do,” further stressing the company’s attitude towards informing gamblers and helping them get a better understanding of their local gaming environment.</p>
<p>iGaming Blooming in Michigan</p>
<p>Just earlier this month one of the best-known iGaming content creators – Play’n GO – secured a B2B license to operate in Michigan as well. The CEO – Johan Törnqvist – said that the company is “absolutely committed” to US expansion, after its first entry through Michigan. Thanks to this, players will be able to enjoy games such as Reactoonz, Rise of Olympus, Legacy of Dead, Book of Dead, Lord Merlin, and more.</p>
<p>Another US debut was that of White Hat Studios, a White Hat Gaming developer, which launched in the US with its first customer being BetMGM. White Hat Studios CEO Andy Whitworth commented that the company is “delighted to see our products go live in the US, starting with BetMGM in the great state of Michigan. Our games are tried and tested, and we are confident our content will thrill US players,” marking the company’s confidence that this will be a successful partnership.</p>
<p>That positive attitude might turn out to be completely realistic, as more developers and content creators are flooding through the state gates, with Stakelogic joining the ranks as another exclusive iGaming developer, that’s recently launched in Michigan. The company’s provisional license will allow the company to “become a leading provider of popular online casino content” in the US market, as CEO Stephan van den Oetelaar put it.</p>
<p>All of these companies are from the same industry, working towards the same goal and Michigan seems to be a great entry point for external platform providers, game developers, and other content creators. That’s great news for the state, as per official data pointing to “internet gaming gross receipts” totaling US$121.24 million in January, and “internet sports betting gross receipts” totaling US$34.68 million. That’s around US$20 million in taxes and payments that the state of Michigan has received during January alone, with iGaming taxes and fees totaling US$19.1 million and internet sports betting taxes and fees around US$1.4 million. Figures for June are slightly lower, with a combined total of US$136.9 million in total gross receipts.</p>
