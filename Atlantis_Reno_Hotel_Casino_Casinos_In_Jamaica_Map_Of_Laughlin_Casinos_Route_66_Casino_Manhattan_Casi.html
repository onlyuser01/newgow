<p>The club is an integral part of North Queensland’s DNA, Tabcorp’s senior sponsorship and events manager said</p>
<p>The Australian online racing and sports betting giant TAB has penned a new agreement with the North Queensland Toyota Cowboys, an Australian professional rugby league football club. As agreed, the operator will be named the team’s platinum partner.</p>
<p>Under the new deal between TAB and the Cowboys, the gambling company’s logo will appear on the sternum of the athletes’ jerseys throughout the 2023 season.</p>
<p>The Cowboys’ chief executive officer, Jeff Reibel, released a statement on the new agreement, sharing his sentiments about the agreement. According to him, the deal with TAB attests to the club’s dedication to providing sports fans with premium experiences.</p>
<p>Since the 1960s TAB has been a household name, having supported sports enthusiasts in every code to experience the thrill of backing their favorite team or athlete competing at the highest level. Jeff Reibel, CEO, North Queensland Toyota Cowboys</p>
<p>Reibel added that the Cowboys and TAB share a passion for Australian sports and have reputation for “beating the odds time and time again to deliver extraordinary moments.” Successfully lobbying for a team in 1995’s Winfield Cup and winning the Premiership in 2015 are two of the club’s most notable achievements, attesting to its commitment to excellence.</p>
<p>The Club Is a Part of North Queensland’s DNA</p>
<p>Tabcorp, TAB’s parent company, also released a statement on the agreement with the Cowboys. The gambling company’s senior sponsorship manager, Katherine Morgan, said that her team is excited to join forces with the North Queensland Toyota Cowboys.</p>
<p>Morgan explained that the club is an integral part of the DNA of North Queensland. She said that Tavbcorp is delighted to forge this partnership with the club and grow the TAB brand. Morgan said that fans should stay tuned for the various activations the two parties have planned.</p>
<p>Queenslanders love their sport and we’re incredibly committed to investing in the growth and promotion of the state’s sports teams and race clubs. Katherine Morgan, senior sponsorship and events manager, Tabcorp</p>
<p>The deal, as noted by Morgan, comes at an exciting time for TAB. The company recently launched a new TAB application, provided customers with new wagering products and enhanced the wagering experience for its fans. The complete transformation of the company is expected to drive more engagement, helping punters make unforgettable memories.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Tabcorp partnered with EPIC Risk Management, which agreed to educate the gambling company’s workers about safer gambling and harm minimization. The company is committed to growing its brand while keeping its customers safe.</p>
