<p>Sevilla and Roma travel to Budapest on Wednesday, May 31, 2023, to lock horns in the battle for the 2023 Europa League trophy</p>
<p>Sevilla is the most successful team in the history of the Europa League/UEFA Cup with six trophies in its collection. This team has never lost in the Final, but AS Roma is determined to make it a first. If Jose Mourinho’s boys pull it off, it’s going to be the first-ever Europa League title for the team from the Italian capital.</p>

<p>Sevilla’s Risen from the Ashes at the Perfect Moment</p>
<p>Despite an awful start to the 2022-223 campaign (in all competitions), Sevilla’s fans can be satisfied with this season. Their boys will probably finish in the top 10, which isn’t bad considering that just a few months ago, they were very close to the relegation zone.</p>
<p>More importantly, Sevilla stands a chance to add another UEFA Europa League trophy to its collection. If the boys from Seville beat AS Roma on Wednesday at Puskas Stadium in Budapest, it’s going to be their seventh triumph in this competition.</p>

<p>So, can they beat Mourinho’s Roma? Sevilla’s been in top shape lately, which isn’t surprising knowing how strong this team’s roster is. They’ve got at least one world-class player in every position on the pitch. For instance, Morocco’s goalie Bono is between the posts, while two World Cup winners from Argentina are in the defensive line – Gonzalo Montiel and Marcos Acuna.</p>
<p>Knowing this, it’s no surprise that Sevilla is a team that’s very hard to score against. In the 2022-23 Europa League campaign, this team’s conceded only seven goals in eight games. This is actually a great achievement considering that Sevilla played against some real heavyweights in those eight matches, including Manchester United and Juventus.</p>
<p>“I Giallorossi” Have a Big-Game Expert Jose Mourinho to Lead Them</p>
<p>Sevilla’s coach is Jose Luis Mendilibar, a former Alaves manager who got his new job on March 23, 2023. So far, he’s done great with this team, but one just cannot compare him with AS Roma’s boss. Jose Mourinho is one of the greatest managers of all time and is an absolute expert for big games such as the Europa League Final.</p>
<p>Jose Mourinho has managed and won 5 European finals in his career. Out of these games, his teams have only conceded 2 goals which was a 3-2 win for Porto over Celtics.</p>
<p>All I’ll say to Roma fans, stay calm. Mourinho was born for these games.</p>

<p>Even without Mourinho, AS Roma would still stand a very good chance to win the trophy in Budapest. This team’s roster looks phenomenal in 2023, with plenty of hard-working players in all positions. They’ve been brilliant defensively this season, even though their biggest stars are players from the offensive department – Paulo Dybala, Stephan El Shaarawy, Tammy Abraham, and so on.</p>
<p>These guys might not be scoring as many goals as expected, but it’s because Mourinho’s given them many other duties. They all work hard, covering huge distances all over the pitch. This is why finding the net against Mourinho’s team is a real challenge. The evidence of this is that since the start of 2023, only one team (Feyenoord) has scored against AS Roma in the Europa League.</p>
<p>Sevilla vs Roma Europa League Prediction</p>
<p>Jose Mourinho’s AS Roma is going to park the bus in front of the goal, and we might see Mendilibar’s boys do something similar. As a result, we probably won’t see too many goal chances on either end. Instead, the real battle will be fought in the center of the pitch.</p>
<p>We think it’s very, very likely “under 2.5 goals” will hit in the 2023 Europa League Final, with the scoreline being tied at the end of the 90 minutes of regular time. In fact, we wouldn’t be surprised if the winner was decided by a penalty shootout. If it happens, it’s AS Roma that’ll have an advantage.</p>
<p>Pick: Sevilla and Roma to draw; under 2.5 goals</p>
