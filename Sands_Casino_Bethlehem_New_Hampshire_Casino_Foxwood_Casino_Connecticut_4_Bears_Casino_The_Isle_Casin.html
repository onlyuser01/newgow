<p>In a fresh deal for the horse racing industry in Australia, Sportsbet has negotiated a broadcasting partnership with RMG and SIS for British and Irish horse racing derbies.</p>
<p>Sportsbet Facilitates Horse Racing Programming Through RMG Deal</p>
<p>Australia’s sizeable horse racing fan base will soon be able to experience more British and Irish horseracing content as a multi-year partnership has been agreed between Racecourse Media Group (RMG) in collaboration with Sports Information Service (SIS) and Sportsbet: an Australian online bookmaker offering betting services to over 1.25 million clients and founded in 1993, and owned by Flutter Entertainment since 2016.</p>
<p>RMG is the umbrella organization for 34 racecourses such as Aintree, Leicester, Perth or York. The agreement will allow British and Irish racing to be shown on Sportsbet’s digital platforms, in addition to the current broadcasts on the Tabcorp’s (TAB) SKY Racing network in the TAB application.</p>
<p>“UK and Irish horseracing content is an important contributor to Flutter’s revenues in jurisdictions around the world, and we are delighted to now be able to bring live pictures and additional content to Sportsbet’s Australian customers,” stated Paul Witten, SIS’s Commercial Director.</p>
<p>Bringing More Horse Racing to Australian Crowds</p>
<p>RMG’s Commercial Director Nick Mills said: “We are delighted to team up with Sportsbet and grateful to our long-standing partners, Tabcorp, for helping to facilitate the partnership through broader distribution of its SKY Racing channel. This is a very exciting opportunity to increase the shop window for our racecourses, as well as generate additional international revenue.”</p>
<p>GM of Sports Partnerships at Sportsbet Paul Bittar was happy to be teaming up with RMG and SIS to bring a quality live streaming service of British and Irish horse racing to fans. Sportsbet already has a good standing in Australia, allowing it to deliver content to millions of horse racing aficionados, on top of established events such as the Melbourne Cup, which was bogged down in a bit of controversy this year.</p>
<p>The RMG deal allows the platform to advance its strategy which focuses on high-end racing content. More importantly, Sportsbet is able to contribute to the sustainability of British and Irish horse racing, Bittar noted.</p>
<p>As Australia’s biggest poker event, Australian Poker Million Tournament, is postponed because of the covid-19 pandemic, bookies are on their way to a strong deal. The prestigious event that should have taken place has been delayed indefinitely, but is not the only one: other events had to be postponed until the situation returns to normal, including the 2021 Australian Open. These decisions ensure the participants’ safety and health.</p>
