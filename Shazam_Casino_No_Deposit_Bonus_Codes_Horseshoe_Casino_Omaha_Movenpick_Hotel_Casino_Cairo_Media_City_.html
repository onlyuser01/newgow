<p>Diamong Eagle Corp /DEAC/, the Special Purpose Acquisition Company /SPAC/ created for the merger between DraftKings and SBTech, announced last week its shareholders approved the deal that involved the Boston-based fantasy and sports book operator and the European technology provider.</p>
<p>Subsequently, this meant that since Friday, April 24, DraftKings started trading on the NASDAQ as the only vertically-integrated sports betting and online gaming company based in the US. But it also meant DEAC should file with the Securities and Exchange Commission /SEC/, the exchange regulatory body, some registration documents.</p>
<p>The Walt Disney Company Among the Shareholders</p>
<p>Schedule 13G filed under the Securities Exchange Act, 1934, revealed one of the significant shareholders of the newly-formed entity is The Walt Disney Company, owning 6% of the company’s stock. In March 2019, The Walt Disney Company acquired 21st Century Fox in a deal worth $71.3 billion. As part of that deal Disney acquired a stake in DraftKings, due to Fox’s 2015 $160 million investment into the Boston-based fantasy sports provider.</p>
<p>The multinational mass media and entertainment company is classified as a passive investor, a classification that prevents Disney from investing into DraftKings’ competitors, but also shows the media giant sees long-term potential for its investment in the gaming company.</p>
<p>DraftKings’ Loss, SBTech’s Profit</p>
<p>Another detail revealed in the prospectus filed by DEAC to the SEC is that DraftKings registered $114.1 million loss for the first 9 months of 2019. Despite posting 44.3% jump in revenues for the period, to $192 million, DraftKings’ direct costs skyrocketed by 143.5%, to $64.7 million, leading to an operating loss of more than $115 million, a 52% rise year-on-year.</p>
<p>The new betting technology provider for DraftKings that is set to replace Kambi, SBTech, registered profit for the period, $36.5 million, despite having its revenue down 6.7% year-on-year, to $76.8 million, which was more than offset by the 18.6% drop in direct costs, to $40.2 million.</p>
<p>Indemnification Provisions</p>
<p>Another interesting detail revealed to the SEC is that Diamond Eagle is expecting some legal repercussions from the recent cyber-attack on the database servers of SBTech. In March, the betting technology provider had to shut down its operations to all of its 50 B2B global partners, as a protective measure for its data centres, which apparently were under a cyber-attack.</p>
<p>The document revealed that all parties agreed to create an escrow fund of $10 million from the amount due to be received by SBTech that will be held for 2 years in case of any future indemnification claims. Another $20 million of Class A shares for SBTech and its option holders will be locked down, also for 2 years.</p>
<p>In case these turn out to be insufficient to satisfy potential claims, the new DraftKings will be entitled to use the other SBTech’s indemnification provisions, $25 million cash escrow and $45 million of stock.</p>
