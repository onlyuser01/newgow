<p>Rush Street Interactive (RSI) is expanding its access and presence in different gaming markets across the United States through a new partnership with Penn National Gaming. As a result, the company has secured market access to Ohio, Maryland, and Missouri, where it will be able to launch its iGaming platform, namely through the BetRivers product.</p>
<p>Beating Legislators to the Punch</p>
<p>The deal outlines a scenario in which BetRivers and RSI will be able to offer the product for up to 20 years and potentially expand to a second skin should one be available in each jurisdiction, based on both the current regulatory expectations and the commercial availability of such.</p>
<p>Not all states have launched gambling products though, with Maryland only rolling out sports betting at the turn of 2022, and Ohio expected to be up and running in April. As to Missouri, the state is still negotiating a sports betting bill that should be able to pass this year. However, RSI is losing no time, confident in the potential success of the legislation.</p>
<p>Commenting on these developments, RSI president Richard Schwartz said that the company was pleased with the new deals in the three respective markets and that the company was moving on track to continue with its core strategy for the United States.</p>
<p>That strategy, Schwartz explained was to bring a prime iGaming experience to key markets across the country. He specifically spoke about the BetRivers.com brand:</p>
<p>“The addition of Ohio, Maryland and Missouri to our market access portfolio, specifically, builds on RSI’s success in neighboring states and will create enhanced marketing efficiencies for our BetRivers.com brand.” RSI president Richard Schwartz</p>
<p>Rush Street Interactive has been able to launch in a number of new iGaming markets in the United States, including New York, Connecticut, and Arizona.</p>
<p>North America Remains a Key Focus for RSI</p>
<p>North America remains an important part of the company’s ambitions which has pushed it to pursue new opportunities in Canada, which is expected to generate one of the biggest iGaming windfall for private operators. Ontario is set to welcome private companies in April.</p>
<p>Schwartz is committed to expanding Rush Street Interactive’s footprint and to achieve this, the company has been in continuous dialogue with industry stakeholders, both tribal and commercial operators. Further market access to new markets in the United States remains the default course of action in 2022.</p>
<p>The company though is expanding elsewhere, too. At the end of January, Rush Street Interactive announced a partnership in Mexico with Grupo Multimedios, gaining 25-year access to the Latin American market.</p>
