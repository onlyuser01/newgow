<p>PokerStars values your time to the point where the Turbo Series are now back and they bring heftier rewards along. Starting on February 3, the fast-paced tournament will be returning to offer $25 million on the line across over 100 separate events.</p>
<p>Fight for $3 million in guaranteed prize money from the two Main Events on February 17</p>
<p>The Turbo Series offer buy-ins between $55 and $5,000</p>
<p>Over $75 million to be dished out between February 3 and February 17</p>
<p>The Turbo Series Make a Comeback in 2019</p>
<p>PokerStars has achieved broad recognition worldwide occasioned by dozens of live events and perhaps hundreds of online competitions. The card room has a lot to offer to those who seek to play on a budget and those that want to pursue better pay-outs.</p>
<p>In any event, one of the defining traits of PokerStars has been the diversity of options, competitive formats and innovative approach to the game – from the World Championship of Online Poker (WCOOP), to the virtual reality competitions adopted by the platform, to their Spring Championship Online Poker (SCOOP).</p>
<p>Now, there are complementary Turbo Series, which will bring the solid $25 million to the table spread across 114 events. The competition will run from February 3 through February 17.</p>
<p>Making the Actual Cut</p>
<p>In true PokerStars spirit, the entry-level will be quite accessible, with the buy-ins varying between $11 and $5,200 a pop. The tournament will also feature progress knockout events, which will come with heftier prize pools and steeper buy-ins.</p>
<p>There's still time to enter our competition to win #TurboSeries tickets. We want to hear about your heroic bluffs. ⬇️ https://t.co/3Wb0qlEbgB — PokerStars (@PokerStars) January 23, 2019</p>
<p>The $1,050 Main Event comes with $2 million in guaranteed prize money, but you needn’t worry about fitting the bill. PokerStars offers players $2.50 tickets to the Turbo Series events, as long as you manage to clear the qualifying competitions.</p>
<p>PokerStars’ special Spin &amp; Go’s allow anyone who has won a ticket from these events to participate either in the Turbo Series or join in the satellites.</p>
<p>There are other community-focused initiatives that can still get players an entry into the fray, including the “biggest bluff” , whereby players get to share how they’ve bluffed their way into the tournament for extra rewards.</p>
<p>Over $3 Million in Final Events Action</p>
<p>Apart from the big Main Event, there’s a second one which will be held on the same day, January 17. The buy-in to the smaller Main Event is just $55, making for an accommodating and affordable way into the event.</p>
<p>The Turbo Series is just a part of what PokerStars has prepared for its followers and player base in February. There will be other watershed pow-wows, including the Sunday Million and Sunday Storm, which will together bring the total prize pool to $75 million over the span of the tournament period.</p>
