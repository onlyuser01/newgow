<p>Happyhour.io has revealed a new investment into Betsala.com, online sports betting operator and brand in Chile. This is the latest move in the gambling industry space by the seed and early-stage accelerator company which has been investing in a number of entities across the full spectrum of the industry to drive innovation, and local success stories and help shape the conversation around gambling.</p>
<p>Building for the Future, Building for Success</p>
<p>Betsala.com has a unique proposition all of its own, providing a Free Bet Club running weekly and a clear-cut focus on local market odds and opportunities. This new investment round will bring in more opportunities for growth and accelerate the current roadmap to strengthen the company’s position in the local market.</p>
<p>Betsala.com has been able to rapidly establish a strong presence in the Chilean sports betting market. It notably added Marcelo “Matador” Salas as the company’s brand ambassador. Happyhour.io will make sure that the brand capitalizes on its standing in the region and will provide Betsala with its operational, product, and tech expertise to guide its growth and further opportunities down the road.</p>
<p>Chile is no random investment on the part of Happyhour.io, a company known for its business acumen and prowess, which has been singling out promising companies with surgical precision.</p>
<p>Chile Proves Fertile Ground for Investment</p>
<p>The Chilean betting market alone is on track to hit $425 million in gross gaming revenue over the next five years. Betsala CEO Albert Bellavista welcomed this opportunity and said:</p>
<p>We have the right management team, experience, and vision to be a sports betting and gaming powerhouse in Chile. The investment from Happyhour will allow us to scale rapidly with a product and operational know-how to become the sports betting brand in Latin America.</p>
<p>The news was similarly welcomed by Happyhour CEO Robin Reed, a long-time industry veteran with a proven track record and business standing in gambling. Reed said that his team invests in people and entities that bring a promise to transform the industry. As one of the future biggest operators in the Chilean betting market, the addition of Betsala makes for a worthwhile choice.</p>
