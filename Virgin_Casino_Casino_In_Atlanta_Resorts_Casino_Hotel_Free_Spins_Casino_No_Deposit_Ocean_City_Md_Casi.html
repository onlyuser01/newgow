<p>Additional Details Regarding Ubisoft’s Futuristic Shooter Hyper Scape</p>
<p>Ubisoft’s new fist person battle royal shooter Hyper Scape brings an entire new look of the battle royal genre. This is because players who fight engage on both horizontal and vertical fights. In other words, players battles take place anywhere in the battle ground from the streets to the rooftops. Besides variety of futuristic weapons, players can also use special abilities known as “Hacks“.</p>
<p>Up to 99 players fight in an event called Crown Rush, whereas the world continues to shrink over time. With more players eliminated, once there is one final sector remaining, this is when the Crown appears. The developers labeled this phase of the game as “Showdown“. To win the game, players must either eliminate the other teams or hold the crown for 45 seconds.</p>
<p>In addition, we cannot miss to mention the futuristic approach of the developer in terms of game interaction between the players and viewers on Twitch. According to the team, the new: “Crowncast Twitch extension allows viewers to vote on game-changing effects that impact all players in real-time!” With that in mind, Ubisoft announced that further details on this contemporary feature are expected soon.</p>
