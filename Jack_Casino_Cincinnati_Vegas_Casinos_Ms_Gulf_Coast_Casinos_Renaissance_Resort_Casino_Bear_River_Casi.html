    <h1>Jack Casino Cincinnati Vegas Casinos Ms Gulf Coast Casinos Renaissance Resort Casino Bear River Casi</h1>

<p>Dear Casinoguru Team,</p>
<p>I have an account at Nomini Casino where I wanted to make a withdrawal. The credit on my account is almost 7600 euros . The live chat then told me I had to verify my account.</p>
<p>I then asked in the live chat if there was a certain time window or time in which I had to successfully verify my account. The live chat said there is no time limit to verify my account.</p>
<p>I had already uploaded a document to my account, but it was rejected "I believe due to poor quality or image clarity". This was an invoice.</p>
<p>When I wanted to upload more documents, I saw in my mailbox that I had received an email saying: "My account has been closed. I received the email on June 15th, 2023 with the following reason:</p>
<p>"We would want to inform you that your account has been closed for not providing documents in time, your winnings has been deducted. We kindly request your bank details for manual withdrawal of your deposit."</p>
<p>You see that is a contradiction in terms . Since I was assured via live chat there is no time limit for my account verification.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I was in the hospital for the last few weeks due to my lung disease and unfortunately I couldn't check if I received an email.</p>
<p>I would therefore like to verify my account. I was discharged from the hospital yesterday and am now finding time to do so.</p>
<p>You will also see that there hasn't been any activity on my account lately, as I said I was prevented from doing so due to my hospital stay.</p>
<p>Attachment: Screenshot of the email</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your effort and patience.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Frank Munster</p>
