<p>Mount Magmas review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This slot has a volcano and gemstone theme.</p>
<p>Under clouds of smoke, players will face the heat of lava. A reel filled with tantalising jewels keeps things interesting, though players will have to keep sweat off their brow.</p>
<p>This game is a good pick for fans of gem-themed slots and even lovers of the Lord of the Rings trilogy who really want to visit Mordor.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a dramatic melody that adds to the high fantasy feel of this world. The reels spin and land with a light clicking sound that feels out of place given that the symbols are hefty-looking stones. A clunking sound would have matched the aesthetic a little better.</p>
<p>Behind the reels is a smouldering land of ash and fire. Majestic volcanoes stand, tops glowing with hot lava. This location is clearly not for the faint of heart and players will feel as though they are adventurers on a quest.</p>
<p>The reels themselves are filled with rough gems that seem to glow in the firelight. Unlike some games where the jewels are animated as cut and glossy, the precious stones in this game are clearly fresh from the ground.</p>
<p>Overall, the animation and soundtrack merge to create a formidable world with connotations of fantasy epics.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Mount Magmas is a five reel, four row slot with 20 win lines.</p>
<p>Gameplay is fast and engaging, ensuring that it will hold players’ attention.</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Magma Rock symbol.</p>
<p>The Magma Rock symbols are collected during the base game. After being collected, the position on the reels they occupied is filled with a Wild symbol.</p>
<p>The Volcano Bonus feature is triggered at random after a Magma rock is collected. During this feature, players will be presented with a selection of tiles that will reveal prizes, continue the feature, or end the feature.</p>
<p>The Daily Jackpot feature is guaranteed to pay out to someone within a defined period of time. Players will be able to see the jackpot prize as well as a timer counting down until it is won.</p>
<p>The Mega Jackpot feature is also guaranteed to pay out to someone within a defined time period. As with the Daily Jackpot, players will be able to see the available jackpot and a timer indicating the maximum amount of time that will pass before it is won.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.5%, above our yardstick for average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.20 up to a maximum of $/£/€80.00 per spin.</p>
<p>The volatility of this game is medium, which makes it a less ideal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. Our slot strategies target the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, medium volatility volcano-themed slot.</p>
<p>Though the volatility is not ideal from a strategy perspective, this game’s high RTP and immersive theme make it a fun stop.</p>
<p>Players with their eyes on maximising their wins may wish to move from this game to one with a higher volatility, but they won’t regret taking the time to check it out.</p>
