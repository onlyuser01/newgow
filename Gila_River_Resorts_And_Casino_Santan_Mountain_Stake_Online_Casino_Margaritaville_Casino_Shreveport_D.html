<p>Wazdan, a respected iGaming studio and developer of products for the online casino vertical, has announced a new content partnership with Golden Grand, an operator. The partnership will see Wazdan bring its distinct portfolio of titles onto the Swiss market with the help of Golden Grand, which is the official online arm of Airport Casino Basel AG.</p>
<p>Golden Grand launched over a year ago, and it has already been able to quickly grow its local footprint and become a known name and fixture in the country’s iGaming landscape. The content tie-up with Wazdan will only add to the operator’s position in the market and help it deliver more worthwhile games to its players.</p>
<p>Apart from games, players will garner access to engaging studio features that have had a strong pull with audiences abroad, including Hold theJackpot and Collect to Infinity, all of which have been incorporated into Wazdan’s leading and top-performing titles. Both features are linked to better overall engagement.</p>
<p>Wazdan is also the sixth studio and content partner for Golden Grand, which continues to seek stronger placement in the local iGaming market, which has proven very competitive over the last months, with new suppliers making their mark on the country, and offering consumers critically acclaimed and innovation-rich products.</p>
<p>Both Wazdan and Golden Grand have hailed the opportunity this partnership now introduced, as the brands are keen to see their momentum in the market grow. Wazdan Chief Commercial officer Andrzej Hyla outlined the company’s plans for the market, and said that Switzerland was firmly on the company’s priorities when looking to expand in the regulated iGaming ecosystem in Europe.</p>
<p>"We are delighted to partner with Golden Grand and deliver our comprehensive slot offering for even more players to enjoy," Hyla concluded. Golden Grand will see titles such as Power of Gods: Hades, Magic Spins, Sizzling Moon, 9 Lions and Sun of Fortune all integrated with its portfolio.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Golden Grand Director Online Casino Adrian Schiesser was similarly pleased with the opportunity to expand the operator’s library with more award-winning games.</p>
<p>"We are highly confident that Wazdan’s innovative gameplay, unique features, and high-quality graphics will have a lot of success on Golden Grand," Schiesser noted. The partnership is no doubt a great new commercial opportunity for Wazdan as well. Wazdan is no stranger to the iGaming market in Switzerland, having previously teamed up with MyCasino in December.</p>
