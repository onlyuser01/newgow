    <h1>Grand Sierra Resort And Casino Reno Nv Altoona Casino Riverside Casino And Golf Resort Iowa City Pla</h1>

<p>After the successful launch of its community Power Jackpot in 2022, leading iGaming content provider Pragmatic Play has announced an equally exciting release designed for operators interested in better rates of engagement and player acquisition.</p>
<p>Jackpot Play is the name of the studio’s latest addition to its impressive jackpot portfolio. The new product promises “substantial cash prizes” and it will become accessible across the constantly-growing selection of slots from the studio.</p>
<p>June has been a busy month for the company. Last week, Pragmatic Play announced it would introduce a bespoke roulette game option to Interwetten, following the news of its live casino games being introduced to Grand Casino Luzern’s brand, mycasino, in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Creating Local Networks of Progressive Jackpot Games</p>
<p>Operators interested in including the new Jackpot Play product across their casino brands will have the opportunity to easily configure it using customizable options and generate local progressive jackpot networks connected to iconic games on the market.</p>
<p>The list includes a series of award-winning titles including Gates of Olympus, Sugar Rush, Sweet Bonanza, The Dog House, Joker’s Jewels, Book of Tut, Fruit Party, Starlight Princess, and Big Bass Bonanza. Fresh slot games are planned for release in the upcoming months.</p>
<p>At the moment, the provider produces and releases up to eight new online slot games on a monthly basis while busy offering bingo titles, casino, and virtual sports alternatives in its multi-product portfolio.</p>
<p>Random Progressive Jackpot Drops</p>
<p>The progressive jackpot will drop at random moments while engaged in gameplay, and it is embedded in a mini-game played on a 4×3 grid. Players will be required to make their pick from a rich selection of gems to find out how much they won.</p>
<p>Integration is completed using the studio’s Jackpot application programming interface. The progressive jackpot consists of four standard tiers: Minor, Major, Mega, and Grand. Each of the tiers features its own win probability as well as its own jackpot seed.</p>
<p>Seamless wallet and balance transfers will bring massive cash prizes to winning players. Operators are also allowed to create special Jackpot Play categories on their platforms or use external channels for the same purpose.</p>
<p>The company’s chief operating officer, Irina Cornides, expressed their delight about being able to announce the addition of Jackpot Play to their ever-growing portfolio of jackpot games.</p>
<p>By comparison, the studio’s network progressive jackpot, Power Jackpot, rewards both the winner and 1,000 runners-up once the top prize is dropped. The jackpot feature is available on their upgraded Wolf Gold game and it introduces a multiplier wheel and four tiers: Mini, Minor, Major, and Power. On average, the Power Jackpot is expected to drop at €4.5 million ($4.9 million).</p>
