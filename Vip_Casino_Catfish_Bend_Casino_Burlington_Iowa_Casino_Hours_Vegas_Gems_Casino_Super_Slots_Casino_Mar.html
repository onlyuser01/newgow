    <h1>Vip Casino Catfish Bend Casino Burlington Iowa Casino Hours Vegas Gems Casino Super Slots Casino Mar</h1>

<p>The casino industry in Asia continues to recover from the impact of the pandemic-related restrictions, proves an advertisement for a two-day recruitment fair at Marina Bay Sands.</p>
<p>‘Begin Your Career Journey with Marina Bay Sands!’</p>
<p>The casino resort operated by Marina Bay Sands, a subsidiary of Las Vegas Sands, will hold the first walk-in recruitment fair since 2020 on May 30-31, looking to fill in vacancies across various departments and promising to hire at least 2,000 people.</p>
<p>“As a long-term employer, Marina Bay Sands continues to invest not only in our infrastructure but also in building a sustainable workforce for the future.” Chan Yit Foon, SVP, Human Resources, Marina Bay Sands</p>
<p>According to the press release from Marina Bay Sands published Wednesday, the departments hiring staff will have dedicated booths at the two-day recruitment event to enable the fast-tracking of applications and on-site interviews for applicants.</p>
<p>“This upcoming career fair has been in the making since the pandemic, and is especially timely as we welcome visitors back.” Chan Yit Foon, SVP, Human Resources, Marina Bay Sands</p>
<p>Marina Bay Sands’ casino department will be looking to fill roles within marketing such as VIP Host, Customer Services Executive and Paiza Services Executive, table games and cage operations, while the food and beverage department is seeking to fill both front-of-house and back-of-house positions.</p>
<p>The integrated casino resort will also appoint staff in positions in the supply chain, security services, surveillance, facilities and public area maintenance, mall management, transportation, and other corporate roles.</p>
<p>The two-day recruitment event follows nearly six months after a similar hiring event took place virtually. The ‘Virtual Career Fair’ was held in December to fill in 1,000 vacancies at the casino resort that is increasing its role in Las Vegas Sands’ portfolio of integrated casino resorts.</p>
<p>Deepening Commitment to Asian Operations</p>
<p>In February, the parent company announced the biggest reinvestment plan to date for its Singapore integrated casino property as a display of its deepening commitment to the region and in particular to Singapore and its tourism sector.</p>
<p>The $1 billion reinvestment plan will span across hotel rooms and suites, new food and beverage offerings, and other enhancements, and is separate from the multi-billion expansion announced in April 2019 that sought to bring in a state-of-the-art entertainment arena, an ultra-luxury hotel tower and additional meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibition space adjacent to the integrated resort.</p>
<p>In March, legislators in the Asian country affirmed their intent to overhaul the country’s gambling industry by introducing two bills: the Gambling Control Bill and the Gambling Regulatory Authority of Singapore (GRA) Bill.</p>
<p>The Gambling Control Bill is seeking to criminalize offenses like proxy betting and underage gambling and create licensing conditions for popular gambling products such as pools, fruit machines and others, while the GRA Bill is looking to establish a unified regulatory body, Casino Regulatory Authority, similar to the UK Gambling Commission.</p>
