    <h1>Altantic City Casinos Casino Free Bonus No Deposit Casino In Gatlinburg Tn Horseshoe Casino Shrevepo</h1>

<p>British online casino operator PlatinCasino.co.uk has put out a quite unorthodox and intriguing gig for people with some time to spend. The operator is seeking enthusiasts who are willing to watch the whole Simpsons franchise for a tempting reward of $7,000.</p>
<p>PlatinCasino’s Unusual Gig</p>
<p>The reason behind this rather unusual job is that PlatinCasino wants to know how many of the events in the popular animated sitcom coincide with real-life events. The Simpsons’ humor has oftentimes presented situations that have later come to reality in one way or another. People have pointed out that the show has “predicted” the election of Donald Trump as a President of the United States, the COVID-19 outbreak, and the current fuel shortages in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Therefore, people who take on PlatinCasino’s gig will not only be required to watch all of the TV show episodes but will have to keep an eye on any moment that can be connected to a real-life event that happened after the show was aired and note it.</p>
<p>The job won’t be as easy as it sounds, as it will go beyond just watching several episodes of a favorite franchise. Participants will have to go through no less than 32 years of content within a very short period of time and will also have some additional responsibilities. Yet, it may prove to be a highly profitable undertaking as PlatinCasino is willing to pay a $7,000 salary to everyone who gets approved for the task.</p>
<p>Applying for the Job</p>
<p>PlatinCasino will hold applicants to high standards. Everyone who wants to apply must be an adult over 18, be fluent in English, and have the ability to write with flair. Evidently, the applicant needs to own a device on which they will watch the episodes. PlatinCasino will fund the viewer’s WiFi connection and will provide a Disney Plus subscription, needed to access the episodes. Furthermore, those who get approved for the task will get an additional bonus of a weekly box of donuts.</p>
<p>The “Simpsons Series Analyst” will then have the responsible task to carefully watch all the episodes. This is easier said than done as it would mean one should watch 35-36 hours’ worth of The Simpsons every week. The analyst will be required to write down any stand-out storylines and send them over to the PlatinCasino team. Simpsons lovers who are up to PlatinCasino’s unusual task can apply for it through the casino’s official website.</p>
