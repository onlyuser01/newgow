<p>Design Works Gaming continues its expansion in regulated markets across the US. The company received licenses to provide operators with content in Michigan and Pennsylvania. DWG also has a license to operate in New Jersey, which means that by now, the company is licensed in 3 key US states that offer regulated gambling activities.</p>
<p>DWG Expands North American Presence, Receives MI and PA Licenses</p>
<p>Casino games developer Design Works Gaming (DWG) expanded its presence in North America by receiving two licenses for real money online gambling. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) as well as the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB) both approved DWG’s applications for license. As a result, DWG can now provide its suite of games to operators in both Michigan and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The latest announcement complements a content deal that DWG inked with Scientific Games last month. The duo inked an exclusive 3-year deal under which DWG will provide its content via SG’s OpenGaming platform around the US as well as in Canada.</p>
<p>Besides Michigan and Pennsylvania, DWG has previously received a similar license from the gaming regulator in New Jersey. In other words, DWG is now licensed to offer its content to real money online gaming operators within key US states that offer regulated online gambling.</p>
<p>October Was a Busy Month for the Company</p>
<p>DWG’s CEO, Troy Zurawski, said that the company remains focused on transforming the online casino content for the US industry. He outlined that DWG’s goal is to supply all regulated jurisdictions around the country with content. Additionally, Zurawski deemed Michigan and Pennsylvania as exciting new markets that are “crying out for original, world-class content.” He acknowledged that DWG’s proprietary RGS which is integrated with SG Digital will enable the company to offer incredible speed on the market. In conclusion, Zurawski said that the company cannot wait to launch its best-in-class content for players in both states.</p>
<p>“We’re serious about transforming online casino content in the US, and that means taking our games into all regulated jurisdictions across the country.” Troy Zurawski, CEO at Design Works Gaming</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, October has been a busy month for DWG. Earlier this week, the company unveiled that it was shortlisted for the SBC Awards 2021. The prestigious awards are set to take place in London this December. DWG’s nomination is in the category “Innovation in Casino Entertainment.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month, DWG also announced the launch of its first-ever Megaways game. The new slot game dubbed Nifty Fifty Megaways is the result of collaboration between Betfred, DWG as well as Big Time Gaming. This marks the first DWG game to incorporate Big Time Gaming’s innovative Megaways mechanic.</p>
