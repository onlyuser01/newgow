<p>Lucky Streak: a popular casino games provider with a 1,000-meter-square live studio in Latvia</p>
<p>Lucky Streak was founded in 2014 by an experienced team of casino game developers. Its focus was on providing innovative and stylish live casino games to a wide audience, or an 'entertainment-first approach' as they call it.</p>
<p>Operating from a 1,000-square-meter studio in Riga, it began to offer 24/7 broadcasts that beamed live games to online casino players. A team of game presenters worked around the clock to provide interactive entertainment that aimed to make the player feel like they were in a living and breathing casino.</p>
<p>It's an approach that seems to have paid off for Lucky Streak. According to its official site, the company employs over 200 people across Europe, enjoying steady year-by-year growth since its inception.</p>
<p>It runs three programs alongside its live casino games:</p>
<p>LuckyConnect: a portfolio of third-party slot games in partnership with leading gaming providers including Yggdrasil, Playson, Betsoft.</p>

<p>a white-label live casino solution for online gambling sites. Lucky Land-Based: a bespoke solution for land-based casinos.</p>
<p>Lucky Streak's presence in several countries means that online casinos that stock its games are fairly common, but what is it like to play one of those games? The next section aims to find out.</p>
<p>Lucky Streak live casino games and software</p>
<p>Lucky Streak has an impressive collection of live casino games using the latest cloud computing technology, which allows them to stream high quality videos and provide an optimal playing experience. It also uses an HTML5 interface so that you can play on mobile-friendly casinos just as smoothly as on a desktop device.</p>
<p>We can break its gaming library down into three sections:</p>
<p>Live blackjack</p>
<p>Live baccarat</p>
<p>Live roulette, including Live Auto roulette and Dual Play roulette</p>
<p>The first two games are simply live versions of the classic casino card games. You're face-to-face with the human dealer who handles real-life cards for you to bet with. Superimposed onto the table are virtual chips which you can move according to your bet. The games flow just like in a bricks-and-mortar casino, and you can experience the sights and sounds of this environment as you play.</p>
<p>Live roulette, however, comes with a couple of variations on the classic design. All three types come with a live croupier who speaks with players as they play. The croupier spins a real-life wheel, and players must make their bets on a virtual layout. There are multiple camera angles for you to choose from, whether you like a one-on-one view with the croupier, or other angles of the table. You can also keep track of the game history on an interactive graph.</p>
<p>Live Auto roulette removes the need for a croupier. Aimed at fast-paced players, this variation is capable of playing 60 games an hour: all you need to do is place your bets and the game does the rest, without fuss.</p>
<p>Dual Play roulette, meanwhile, lets you play alongside live players in the casino. The opposite of the auto version, here you can engage with other players and the croupier in the live chat feature.</p>

<p>Lucky Streak casino bonuses</p>
<p>Playing in online casinos is a game with negative expected results, in that the longer you play, the more likely it is for the casino to win and you to lose money.</p>
<p>Still, there are some perks to enjoy. Casino bonuses often offer players free credit or spins for making a deposit (deposit bonuses) or sometimes just for registering (no deposit bonuses). While these are often subject to Wagering Requirements (WR), we might be able to get something for nothing from them. Read our How do casino bonuses work? guide for more on this.</p>
<p>But enough of the talk, you're wondering how to find bonuses offered by Lucky Streak casinos, aren't you? Well, here's a quick step-by-step guide about how to do this.</p>
<p>Go to the list of casino bonuses Choose 'Lucky Streak' in the game provider filter Look through the list of bonuses, read the info about them and choose your favorite.</p>
<p>Note: If you'd like to narrow the list down further, then you can also sort them according to the type of bonus. In this case, you go to the 'Bonus Type' filter and make your choice there. For no deposit bonuses, for example, select the 'No Deposit Bonus'. You can get the same results by going to our list of no deposit bonuses and ticking the 'Lucky Streak' box.</p>
<p>Worried about expired bonuses? Don't be. We try our best to make sure the list is always updated.</p>
