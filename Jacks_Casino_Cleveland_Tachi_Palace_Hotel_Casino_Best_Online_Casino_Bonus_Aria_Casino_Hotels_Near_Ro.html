    <h1>Jacks Casino Cleveland Tachi Palace Hotel Casino Best Online Casino Bonus Aria Casino Hotels Near Ro</h1>

<p>On 17.06.2022 at 00:48:24 I deposited 100€, further at 01:34:31 200€, and at 02:19:11 100€. The first deposit contained a bonus, which I gambled away, 0.08€ remaining of the bonus, and then made the other deposits. The third deposit contained a Bonus with FreeSpins which I have not used. After that, I had a balance of 1000€. On 19.06.2022 I continued playing with this balance and had a balance of 7000€ at the end. After the long verification was completed I received the following mail.</p>
<p>"We would like to inform you that the relevant department has completed the review process of your account and the amount of 6600 ,04 € has been removed, leaving your balance at the amount of 400,00 € which is the amount you deposited in order to claim multiple Reload Bonus.</p>
<p>Kindly find below the relevant promotional terms which you have been found to have breached:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Maximum allowed bet before meeting the bonus wagering requirements is €5 per game/spin or the equivalent in other currencies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Larger bets will lead to the confiscation of the bonus assets, freespins and any potential winnings generated with bonus money.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you wish to withdraw before you manage to complete the wagering requirement, then you can cancel your bonus but keep in mind that bonus amount, the generated winnings and any wagered amount will be deducted from your overall balance. Bonus calculates bets with real money amount first and then with the bonus amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This Bonus cannot be used in conjunction with any other promotion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that winnings after canceling the bonus are a result of invalid activity."</p>
<p>I have answered the following:</p>
<p>"Hello I have not made the winnings with a bonus. I have deposited 100 euros with bonus, which I have gambled away and then further once 200 euros without bonus and once 100 euros without bonus deposited, with which I have achieved the winnings."</p>
<p>And got the following answer:</p>
<p>"We would like to inform you that the decision was taken from the relevant security department and it is final after a review was conducted for your account.</p>
<p>Kindly refer to the email sent in order to be clarified about the terms violated in regards to the bonus. Also you are able to check via your history which bonuses were active at the time of your deposits."</p>
<p>And the last answer I give to them:</p>
<p>"I request you to forward my complaint to the relevant department.</p>
<p>On 17.06.2022 at 00:48:24 I deposited 100€, further at 01:34:31 200€ and at 02:19:11 100€. The first deposit contained a bonus, which I gambled away and then made the other deposits,remaining 0.08€ of bonus money.</p>
<p>After the second deposit I played and won. According to your terms:</p>
<ol>
<li>Real money is always used before bonus money when playing with an active bonus on the account.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the 0.08€ of the remaining bonus money could not be a problem. I ask you to explain to me what the problem exactly is.</p>
<p>After that I had a balance of 1000€. On 19.06.2022 I continued playing with this balance and had a balance of 7000€ at the end."</p>
<p>Can you please help me?</p>
