    <h1>Outpost Casino Best Online Casino No Deposit Bonus Winstar Casino Online Sites Like Chumba Casino Ya</h1>

<p>Hey Tomas,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>Pics are attached. I got nothing to hide.</p>
<p>So to answer your questions:</p>
<p>Do I understand correctly you deposited after you completed the free rounds you received as a bonus, but before the wagering of the bonus winnings was completed?</p>
<p>No, I had deposited prior to even starting this bonus and had some funds in the form of BTC AND ETH on my account. These free spins were given to me outta the blue on "Gates of Olympus" by pragmatic play. They were communicated to me by email. Which I still have and can give you the email.</p>
<p>How much did you deposit in addition to the $40 CAD that was on your account at that point?</p>
<p>In two separate occasions I deposited ETH in December 2023, totalling approx 0.04 ETH</p>
<p>In addition I have also deposited BTC in December a few times before this.</p>
<p>Amount of BTC totalling 0.001236 as the last deposit.</p>
<p>There are missing transactions in the form of USDT that I have deposited also. I‚Äôd have to check my wallet because I‚Äôm pretty sure there is more ETH and BTC that seems to be missing as well. In terms of record keeping.</p>
<ul>
<li>from what I understand, Trustdice does not record the transactions when a bonus is applied to a deposit for some reason ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li>
</ul>
<p>If I made wrong assumptions about the situation, don't hesitate to correct me.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt think you made the wrong assumption but let me break this down so we‚Äôre on the same page. Just in case ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>1 - email received for free spins from casino with promo code</p>
<p>2 - promo code entered. Free spins no deposit bonus on game "GATES OF OLYMPUS" played</p>
<p>3 - Win $40 approx in BTC from Free spins ( WINNINGS CAPPED AT $100 MAX WIN )</p>
<p>4 - played various games, wagering bonus requirements on many diff games by many diff game providers using my own BTC and bonus BTC was available for use as well.</p>
<p>5 - On game "Richy Hog" win approx $1060 in BTC / provided with a bragging URL to share with friends or family or to post somewhere.</p>
<p>6 - while playing "Aztec <strong>*</strong>" by pragmatic play, I don‚Äôt recall the exact game name.</p>
<p>WAGERING IS COMPLETE AND Account balance drops to $40.00</p>
<p>7- inquired about bonus, explained as did here to you. More or less ignored.</p>
<p>In a nutshell. Bonus FS were given with a max win of $100 and wagering requirements on game "gates of Olympus"</p>
<p>After FS we‚Äôre played. Total $40 in BTC STEMMING FROM free spins wins was credited to account as casino bonus.</p>
<p>Using real funds playing various games, wagering was completed and the 1060$ was confiscated at time of wagering being complete.</p>
<p>My complaint basically is that the $1060 was won with real funds, which also at the time I was wagering a bonus while winning this $1060.</p>
<p>The FS = $40 win (max win $100) absolutely should have nothing to do with whatever happened afterwards in terms of wins stemming from real funds or even bonus funds.</p>
<p>The 1060$ BTC = won while playing a game by a diff provider with real funds and wagering FS bonus. Shouldn‚Äôt be confiscated because it‚Äôs a win with real money.</p>
<p>In the simplest of terms: If you are wagering a bonus at TRUSTDICE, and win a jackpot or substantial amount, it will get confiscated because your BONUS has a max win ? But the bonus is it‚Äôs own element in on itself, not dictate your real money funds wins.</p>
<p>The FS MAX WIN - should only apply to the actual WINNINGS OF THE FS‚Ä¶. Not to anything afterwards. That‚Äôs just ridiculous.</p>
<p>If you check out the correspondence between myself and the trustdice agent‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll see that she condradicts herself.</p>
<p>She blantadly tells me " The winnings from free spins are capped at 0.001 BTC" which is exactly my Friggen point. Damn it‚Äôs al frustrating. Because the winnings on richi hog were not free spins or have anything to do with a bonus.</p>
