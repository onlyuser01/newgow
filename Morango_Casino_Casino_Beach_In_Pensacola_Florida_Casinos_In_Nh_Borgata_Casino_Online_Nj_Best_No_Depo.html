<p>In Week 8, Thursday Night Football (TNF) will put the Green Bay Packers against the Arizona Cardinals. While the Cardinals are undisputed with the score of 7-0, the Packers aren’t playing around either, with their 6-1 record.</p>
<p>Both teams have been amazing in the offense, which comes as no surprise, knowing how good their quarterbacks are. Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers entered the season as the #1 favorite for the MVP award. However, Arizona’s quarterback, Kyler Murray, took over that spot due to his stellar performances in the past seven weeks.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, it seems that the Week 8 TNF game will be decided by the performance of these two guys. So, who will do better? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>Cardinals Want to Continue Their Unbeaten Run</p>
<p>Over the course of the last seven games, the Cardinals managed to score a whopping 225 points. This translates to an average of a little bit over 32 points per match. Their success is, in no small part, thanks to the outstanding effort of Murray. He managed to score 17 touchdowns (seven in the past two weeks), pass for a total of 2,002 yards, with a completion rate of 73.5%!</p>
<p>Of course, a team cannot go 7-0 with just one player performing great. In Arizona’s case, it seems that everyone’s been playing top football. Despite the fact that the defense is usually overlooked, their performances have been sensational.</p>
<p>The Cards’ defense allowed no more than 20 points on average throughout the season. In fact, their defense is statistically the best out of all teams, with slightly under 16.30 points on average.</p>
<p>All this shows why the Cardinals are seen as the favorite in bookies’ eyes. Still, if there’s any team that can break their win streak, it’s none other than Green Bay, with Rodgers calling the shots.</p>
<p>Packers Looking for their First Win Over the Cards in 9 Years</p>
<p>The Packers have been struggling to win a match against the Cardinals. In fact, we haven’t seen them triumph over the team in nine years.</p>
<p>To be fair, these two played only three times in that period, but still, that’s not a record Rodgers is very proud of. Arizona is one of only a couple of teams against which the legendary QB doesn’t have a positive record.</p>
<p>That seems like good enough motivation for Rodgers to try and improve his record. With him at the top of his game, the Packers look capable of beating any team in the league, Cardinals included.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not going to be easy, especially now that Green Bay’s receiver Davante Adams has been placed on the COVID-19 list. However, even without him, the visitors still look capable of grabbing a win.</p>
<p>Still, from a betting perspective, the best option seems to be to back Green Bay not to lose with too big of a margin. Packers +6.5 looks like the right kind of bet.</p>
<p>Pick: Green Bay Packers +6.5; over should hit in this game.</p>
