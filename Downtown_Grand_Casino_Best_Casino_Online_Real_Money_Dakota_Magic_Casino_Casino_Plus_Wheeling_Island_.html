    <h1>Downtown Grand Casino Best Casino Online Real Money Dakota Magic Casino Casino Plus Wheeling Island</h1>

<p>The leading land-based, lottery and iGaming testing and assessment services provider, Gaming Laboratories International (GLI), announced a new senior leadership appointment.</p>
<p>Industry Veteran Elizabeth Dorgan Bermeosolo Joins GLI</p>
<p>The company revealed on Thursday that it hired the services of the esteemed Spanish gaming executive Elizabeth Dorgan Bermeosolo. Joining GLI’s Latin America and Caribbean Team, Bermeosolo will serve as the new Government Relations and Business Development Executive for the Spanish region. It’s no surprise that for the new leadership position, she will be based in Spain. According to GLI, Bermeosolo will help the company’s clients to take over new opportunities not only within the Spanish region but also throughout Latin America and around the globe.</p>
<p>Bermeosolo has a wealthy experience within the gaming industry. She has a Bachelor of Tourism degree, as well as a Master Executive degree in Hotel Management, Restaurant, Food and Beverage. But her professional background includes significant experience within the hospitality industry as well.</p>
<p>Before joining GLI, Bermeosolo was most recently a part of Spearhead Studios, one of EveryMatrix Group’s in-house game studios. She most recently served at Spearhead Studios as a commercial manager, but her employment background includes other senior leadership positions such as account management team lead, as well as account and sales manager. Before joining Spearhead Studios, Bermeosolo also worked for Gaming Innovation Group (GiG). During her tenure at GiG, she held the position of account manager.</p>
<p>GLI Remains Focused On Growing in Spain</p>
<p>Karen Sierra-Hughes, GLI’s VP of Latin America and the Caribbean, revealed that the company is excited to have an industry professional such as Bermeosolo join its team. She added that as Government Relations and Business Development Executive, Bermeosolo will focus on the client’s needs in the region that include sports betting, online gaming, land-based and lottery.</p>
<p>“GLI is committed to providing first-class service to the Spanish market, and we look forward to developing a closer and stronger collaboration with the Spanish industry.” Karen Sierra-Hughes, VP of Latin America and the Caribbean at GLI</p>
<p>Sierra-Hughes outlined that GLI remains committed to offering the best service for customers in the Spanish market. She outlined that Bermeosolo will undoubtedly help GLI continue its expansion in the country, while at the same time meeting the client’s continuously growing needs.</p>
<p>“With Elizabeth on board, and our continually expanding GLI Spain laboratory, we are more than ready to support our clients’ expansion objectives with timely and thorough services,” added Sierra-Hughes</p>
<p>The latest appointment complements ongoing changes in GLI’s management level team. Only recently, late last month, the company promoted Angela Wong to the position of VP of global lottery solutions. Before that position, Wong served as GLI’s director of lottery solutions.</p>
