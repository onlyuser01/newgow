<p>The Inter Miami vs. Nashville 2023 MLS game is played on Wednesday, August 30, at DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida</p>
<p>Eleven days after Lionel Messi &amp; Co. beat Nashville on penalties to win the Leagues Cup, thereâ€™s another Inter Miami vs. Nashville game to be played. This time, itâ€™s played in the 2023 MLS, and this time, the Herons are playing on their turf.</p>

<p>Inter Miami Looking Unstoppable</p>
<p>The Herons are no longer at the very bottom of the Eastern Conference table of the 2023 MLS, but theyâ€™re still far below the playoff zone. Theyâ€™re trailing by 11 points behind Chicago FC, the closest team from the part of the table that leads to the postseason. However, theyâ€™ve played two games fewer than this team.</p>
<p>What this practically means is that Inter Miami can get to the playoffs if Messi &amp; Co. continue playing great. And that seems very likely at this point.</p>

<p>Watching every second of Lionel Messi play football is a blessing.pic.twitter.com/T4N07j5xhO â€” All About Argentina ðŸ›ŽðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· (@AlbicelesteTalk) August 27, 2023</p>
<p>The Argentine legend has been sensational since coming to America, but the best thing for Inter Miamiâ€™s fans is that his teammates have started playing better as well. In their first MLS game after the League Cup, they beat the New York Red Bulls 2-0 on the road, with one of those goals scored when Messi was on the bench.</p>
<p>The second goal, however, was Messiâ€™s work, but his teammates also played important roles in the build-up. The Herons exchanged several passes, thus splitting open the opposition defense and enabling Messi to launch the ball inside the net.</p>
<p>The Mood in Nashvilleâ€™s Locker Room (Probably) Isnâ€™t Great</p>
<p>Nashville SC players must feel disappointed for coming very close to beating Inter Miami in the Leagues Cup, but still ending up empty-handed. They played 1-1 in regulation with the Herons but then lost on penalties.</p>
<p>The game was played on their turf, after which they went to Georgia to play their first MLS game after the summer break. That did not go well for them â€“ Atlanta United hammered them 4-0 on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>It was Nashvilleâ€™s fourth straight loss in the 2023 MLS, as well as this teamâ€™s seventh loss on the road in the league.</p>
<p>Inter Miami vs. Nashville Prediction</p>
<p>The Herons have no other option but to keep on winning if they want to get themselves to the 2023 MLS Playoffs. They have the motivation, as well as the recipe to beat Nashville, considering that theyâ€™ve already done it once this summer, albeit on penalties. But the game in question was played in Tennessee; the one on August 30 is played in Florida.</p>
<p>Pick: Inter Miami to win</p>
