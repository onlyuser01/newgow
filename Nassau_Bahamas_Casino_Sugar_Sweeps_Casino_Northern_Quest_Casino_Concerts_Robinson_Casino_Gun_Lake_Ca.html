<p>The partnerships with Keeneland and Red Mile will further expand Caesars' presence as a sponsor of horse racing</p>
<p>Caesars Sportsbook, the sports wagering brand of US casino and entertainment giant, Caesars Entertainment, announced it has gained mobile sports betting market access in Kentucky via agreements with Keeneland and Red Mile Gaming &amp; Racing in Lexington.</p>
<p>The agreements with Keeneland and Red Mile Gaming &amp; Racing came ahead of the official launch of legalized sports wagering in Kentucky expected to happen within the next six months and on time for the NFL season.</p>
<p>“Keeneland and Red Mile are iconic horse racing venues with an important legacy in the state of Kentucky,” commented the president of Caesars Digital, Eric Hession, outlining the excellent acceptance of Caesars’ destinations and Caesars horse racing wagering app by Kentuckians.</p>
<p>Besides allowing Caesars Sportsbook to operate mobile wagering, the agreements contain plans to open Central Kentucky’s only retail sportsbook location, with the brick-and-mortar venue still subject to approvals from the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission.</p>
<p>“Working with these historic institutions provides an unmatched opportunity to reach sports and racing fans in the state, and we look forward to working with the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission as we prepare to launch later this year,” he concluded.</p>
<p>The partnership will also make Caesars Sportsbook an official sports betting partner of Keeneland and Red Mile and will provide on-track hospitality and VIP experiences at both racetracks under its industry-leading Caesars Rewards loyalty program.</p>
<p>Helping Venues Attract New Audiences</p>
<p>Keeneland president and chief executive officer, Shannon Arvin, hailed Caesars as “a globally respected brand” committed to racing, outlining the “exciting potential” of the venture with Caesars Sportsbook that would also help the racetrack deliver on its mission “to introduce new audiences to horse racing.”</p>
<p>A National Historic Landmark, Keeneland hosts boutique race meets in April and October and welcomed the Breeder’s Cup World Championships in 2015, 2020, and 2022. Founded in 1936, Keeneland is also the world’s largest Thoroughbred auction house, with auctions taking place five times per year.</p>
<p>Excited to expand the audiences of the historic harness track, Red Mile chief operating officer, Shannon Cobb, stressed that the addition of sports wagering on site would accomplish goals the track has been working on for several years.</p>
<p>Established in 1875, Red Mile is the world’s second-oldest harness racing track and a premier gaming destination with over 950 historic horse racing machines. Subject to regulatory approvals, Caesars Sportsbook intends to operate an on-premise retail sportsbook at Red Mile and bring sports betting, gaming and simulcasting under one roof.</p>
<p>The agreements with Keeneland and Red Mile are the latest displays of Caesar’s commitment to horse racing, further expanding the reach of the Caesars Racebook app, launched in partnership with the New York Racing Association (NYRA).</p>
<p>Caesars is the presenting sponsor of the annual National Horseplayers Championship hosted at Horseshoe Las Vegas and is planning to build a mile-long Thoroughbred racetrack, a casino and a sportsbook at Harrah’s Columbus Racing &amp; Casino in Columbus, Nebraska, in 2024.</p>
