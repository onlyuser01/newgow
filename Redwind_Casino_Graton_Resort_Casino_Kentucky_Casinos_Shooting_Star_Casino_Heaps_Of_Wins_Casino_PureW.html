    <h1>Redwind Casino Graton Resort Casino Kentucky Casinos Shooting Star Casino Heaps Of Wins Casino PureW</h1>

<p>I was playing one of the slots and in free spins , One of spins had great potential (cascades for every win combination) and I almost had max win combination. Casino kicks me out and that free spin is not continued and next free spin triggered without finishing last free spin.</p>
<p>When I reached out to support , most of support have no idea and they have specific templates to respond and more over they dont care about customer and issue.</p>
<p>I have sent almost 100 mails to get it sorted but their response is very bad.</p>
<p>I will be attaching the game history and you can see that after 16th cascade of 6th respin it didnt continue from there. It moved to 7th spin.</p>
