<p>Get Ready to Plot a New Escape Route</p>
<p>The new slot introduces players to a rocky desert theme featuring a peculiar setting represented by a jailhouse. Here, Chapo is seen lurking every once in a while. With nicely designed bars placed underneath the active gaming area and overall cartoonish graphics that complement the adorable human and non-human game characters, the game is eye-catching.</p>
<p>The game elements also consist of a cactus wearing a sombrero hat, buckets on ropes, a hiding donkey, and a variety of cool and playful animations that turn Wild Chapo 2 into a disarmingly engaging sequel to the first game released by the studio. As players are getting ready to plot Chapo’s escape, they get to see the action unfolding in this high-volatility game with six reels and 25 pay lines packed with excellent features.</p>
<p>The list includes free spins, wild re-spins, expanding wilds, and a series of lucrative multipliers with the potential of bringing players’ wins as high as 20,000x the stake. Players who are eager to help the Mexican menace return to civilization even faster are given the chance to bail him out with the help of the buy feature.</p>
<p>“Back with a Vengeance”</p>
<p>As described by Relax Gaming’s director of casino products Shelley Hannah, the new release used the successful first installment as a base, while adding an extra vengeance twist for even more action on the reels. Hannah also praised the large number of game features and top visuals expected to “resonate and take players on a mission” to help Wild Chapo get out of jail while landing lucrative wins.</p>
<p>The studio that received the title for Best Mobile Gaming Software Provider during the EGR B2B Awards in 2022 included a satisfying number of wild re-spins that can occur on the second, third, fourth, or fifth reel. Players will notice the wild re-spins displaying a certain number ranging from one to five. This number stands for the number of wins necessary prior to being collected and it goes down in increments when part of a winning combo. The re-spins carry on until players cannot form any new wins with a wild.</p>
<p>Players are also rewarded with free spins once a minimum of three bonus symbols are scooped up, with the wilds staying on the reels during the free spins until the final spin or until players collect them.</p>
<p>In February 2023, the supplier announced it would deploy its content with bet365. During the same month, the company announced it would pair with AboutSlots to launch a new player-led slot game in July 2023.</p>
