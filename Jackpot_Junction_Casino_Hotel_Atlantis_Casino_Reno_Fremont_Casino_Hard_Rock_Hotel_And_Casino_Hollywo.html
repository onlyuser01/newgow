    <h1>Jackpot Junction Casino Hotel Atlantis Casino Reno Fremont Casino Hard Rock Hotel And Casino Hollywo</h1>

<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>On 23.07.22 I landed a huge Hit on rubyvegas Casino on a 20€ bet and won 100.674€.</p>
<p>After that, the issue with rubyvegas began.</p>
<p>I made a lot of withdraws on this site before and I took maximum two days (that's also the time frame they state in their T&amp;C).</p>
<p>The first withdraw of daily 1.500€ limit processed fast, but every next deposit they did not process for full 11 days (on hold). At the end I manged to withdraw 15.000€ (the monthly limit). But that was needed time until 12.08.22.</p>
<p>On 02.08. I got a bit afraid that I will loose most of my winning because I kept playing, I am a very addictive person. So I asked the support to set a 500€ daily loss limit for my Account at 18:15 GMT+2. In the T&amp;C the Casino writing, that a Player can Set this losslimit if wanted. I Attached the Screenshot of the T&amp;C.</p>
<p>I got very fast am answer, that this request was forwarded to the relevant Departement. And then... Nothing happend for 10 days.</p>
<p>On 13.08.22 I sadly lost all the 85.000€ of my winnings because I kept playing and was able to loose all, even if I asked for the 500€ daily limit, as the Casino writes about in T&amp;C.</p>
<p>After I lost all I wrote a claim and now, they answered instant again. They told me in the first step, that a loss limit is not even available. I said that's not acceptable since T&amp;C says its possible.</p>
<p>Then I got a final decline of my claim.</p>
<p>"This was raised to us for review and following this review, unfortunately, we are unable to refund your losses, when you requested to put a €500.00 daily loss limit in place we have never confirmed with you that this has been actioned, furthermore, you should have had the sense of responsibility to get in touch with us when you realized that these limits have not been enforced rather than playing away your winnings. and as a result of this, we will not be able to refund the losses as requested."</p>
<p>I think it is not fair to put the responsibility only on me. I asked clearly for the limit, it was read and forwarded. But then they never implemented it or answered again. I strongly guess they wanted me to loose all. Before they also denied my request for a higher withdraw limit, even if T&amp;C saying higher VIP leven would reciever higher limits. I was lvl8 of 9 on the site. So a highroll vip player.</p>
<p>Now they closed my account and denied the refund of losses after the limit request. I don't think on 02.08.22 I had 85k left, since my Account is closed I can't check it. So I don't know the exact dispute amount. But it should be around 40-90k</p>
<p>Casinos using T&amp;C to avoid pay players if they do mistakes on it. In this case the Casino did not follow the own T&amp;C so I feel like they should pay the price this time.</p>
<p>Please help me. Thanks a lot</p>
