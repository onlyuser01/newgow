    <h1>The M Casino Las Vegas Nevada Bovada Casino Baldinis Casino Saganing Eagles Landing Casino Saganing</h1>

<p>Good night,</p>
<p>I come to ask for your help because, at the beginning of September, the casino gave me 25 free spins of which I won 100eur, I validated my account, and after the validation was completed I made the withdrawal request, according to the casino rules , I had to make a deposit of 25 € in order for the withdrawal to be accepted.</p>
<p>When making the deposit, the casino offered me a cash bonus that I made a point of canceling immediately, as well as offering 50 rounds, which I was unable to cancel, I played the rounds and tried to cancel the amount won, something that was not possible because it appeared as if it were my money, I considered it to be a casino offer and I played, I made no profits and I deposited + 25 € of which the offers happened again and I canceled the bonuses again, once again the money won with the free spins offered on deposit were not possible to cancel.</p>
<p>I played and won 400 € I made the withdrawal request separately from the first one so that there was no confusion with the winnings, that is, I was left with 2 withdrawal requests, 1 of 100 € of the 25 free spins and another of 400 € of the deposit made.</p>
<p>The following week the casino paid me € 100 and canceled the € 400 order.</p>
<p>I asked why and they said that they only accepted 1 payment per week, given the situation I tried to earn more money, I ended up spending € 300 without making a profit and made the withdrawal request for the remaining € 100, the following week and the casino declines again indicating that to withdraw bonus money I would have to make a deposit of 25 €, I was amazed since the value was not a bonus, and I ended up playing another 25 € that gave a profit, because I got 475 € in total, however I ended up play the € 75 and made the withdrawal request for the € 400.</p>
<p>With the 75 € I played I was lucky enough to have more money and made a withdrawal request for another 400 €, again I placed the orders separately, the latter I played and I had 250 € for withdrawal, last week I did more 1 shipment of 25 € from which I did not make any profit, and what is my amazement when last Friday the casino pays me only 100 € of my first withdrawal request and cancels the 300 €, withdrawing completely from my account, to in addition, he canceled the 250 € withdrawal request but left it in the account, which I have already submitted the withdrawal request again.</p>
<p>I would like to have some help as I have already mentioned to the casino several times that the money is deposit but they insist it was free spins.</p>
