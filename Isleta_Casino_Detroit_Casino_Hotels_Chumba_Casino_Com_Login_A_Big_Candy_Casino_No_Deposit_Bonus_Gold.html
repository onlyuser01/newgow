<p>Carter cooperated with the authorities and was not contacted on the matter again</p>
<p>Reports claim that Maverick Carter, an American sports-marketing businessman and media personality, has admitted to betting with an illegal operator. According to The Washington Post, Carter confessed his involvement in unlicensed gambling in 2021, during the investigation into ex-Minor League pro Wayne Nix.</p>
<p>Back then, Nix plead guilty to the operation of an illegal sports betting business and the filing of false tax returns. During the investigation, Carter admitted to a federal agent that he made roughly 20 bets with the illegal bookmaker.</p>
<p>Carter, who manages the Los Angeles Lakers’ superstar LeBron James, told the federals that he placed around 20 bets with the bookmaker. All of the bets were roughly between $5,000 and $10,000 and were all placed on football and basketball. However, none of the bets Carter made were placed on the Lakes and he did not make any bets on the behalf of other people.</p>
<p>Carter Cooperated with the Authorities</p>
<p>Carter is not an athlete or sports official, meaning he is not barred from wagering on sports, as per the NBA’s rules. As a result, he avoided sanctions from the league.</p>
<p>Adam Mendelsohn, a media spokesperson for Maverick Carter and LeBron James, contacted The Washington Post on the matter, clarifying that the former was never the target of the investigation. Mendelsohn added that the businessman cooperated with the federals and helped resolve the issue.</p>
<p>In addition, Carter was never charged and was never contacted on the matter again, Mendelsohn said.</p>
<p>Nix Ran a Gambling Operation for Athletes</p>
<p>For reference, the Wayne Nix investigation uncovered a longtime-running operation that included many high-profile clients from the sports sector. The operation had been running for over twenty years and was focused on catering to the betting needs of professional athletes (who are, under normal circumstances, prohibited from betting).</p>
<p>The operation was run by former athletes who acted as bookmakers, offering betting on sports to clients across various leagues.</p>
