<p>The Michigan Lottery is set to expand its reach through a new partnership with EQL Games, a studio and supplier of digital content. Thanks to this alliance, EQL Games will be able to roll out its bespoke products on the iLottery platform, empowering players to experience new forms of entertainment the next time they come online.</p>
<p>EQL Deploying Partner Games with Michigan Lottery</p>
<p>The partnership will initially focus on Present Creative, a third-party game developer, but it will also allow for EQL to launch its own signature games in the future. This is the first time EQL and Present Creative have stepped into a new venture as a unit after they revealed their own partnership earlier this month.</p>
<p>Michigan Lottery is touted as the longest-running lottery in the United States and North America as a whole. EQL will deploy its remote game server, enabling the lottery to tap into the full suite of Present Creative content which will be available to players locally without any traction.</p>
<p>This partnership has been welcomed by EQL CEO Brad Cummings who said that he was excited to be working with the Michigan Lottery in the digital space. The executive added:</p>
<p>With this agreement, we look forward to providing exciting new content for the Michigan Lottery for years to come and helping them maintain their market leader status. EQL CEO Brad Cummings</p>
<p>Cummings said that the company was firmly behind Present Creative and its team and portfolio. This new partnership is exciting for all participants as it allows Present’s games to launch with the iLottery platform provided by the Michigan Lottery and enable the company to enter a highly competitive gaming marketplace.</p>
<p>EQL and US Lotteries Go Digital</p>
<p>iLottery solutions are becoming popular across the United States with iGaming and sports betting legalization marching on. Lotteries as such have been licensed in most states across the US, but the concept of digital lotteries is now gathering momentum and is likely to continue growing in popularity.</p>
<p>EQL Games itself is a leader in the US lottery innovation market, providing local lotteries with next-level content and technology. The company’s strength lies in enabling single integrations and the deployment of multiple technologically innovative games. EQL Games has an established track record for providing raffle, traditional and instant draw games, and eInstant games.</p>
