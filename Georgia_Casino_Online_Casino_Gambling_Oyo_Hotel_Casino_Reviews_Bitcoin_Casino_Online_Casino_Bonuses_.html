    <h1>Georgia Casino Online Casino Gambling Oyo Hotel Casino Reviews Bitcoin Casino Online Casino Bonuses</h1>

<p>The country's gambling regulator, Kansspelautoriteit, said that if the operator doesn't discontinue its illegal offering, it would be subject to a €43,000 fine per week up to €129,000</p>
<p>The Dutch gambling authority, Kansspelautoriteit (KSA), constantly monitors activities offered by gambling operators in the country. Such monitoring involves not only the licensed operators but also operators that offer gambling activities without a Dutch license. On Monday, the KSA revealed that its investigation uncovered that the gambling operator, Blue High House SA, offered games of chance to Dutch customers without a permit.</p>
<p>As the gambling regulator in the country, the authority has the right to investigate operators that may be targeting customers in the Netherlands. After one such probe, the KSA said it found that Blue High House offered games of chance via its concreteline.ag website to Dutch customers. This was in breach of the established regulations as the operator doesn’t have a license in the Netherlands, the authority said.</p>
<p>Moreover, the investigation uncovered that “a large number” of Blue High House’s players were from the Netherlands. Considering that the operator offered games of chance without a license, the KSA deemed this an “illegal offering” and said that it must cease immediately. To enforce this, the gambling regulator said that if the operator doesn’t comply, it will be facing a €43,000 ($45,400) monetary penalty per week up to a maximum of €129,000 ($136,100).</p>
<p>“The Gambling Authority imposes a penalty on Blue High House SA for offering games of chance on the concreteline.ag website. Blue High House does not have a permit to do this in the Netherlands and therefore violates the Gambling Act. With the order subject to penalty, the KSA calls on this illegal offer to be stopped immediately,“ reads a statement released by the KSA</p>
<p>The KSA Remains Vigilant</p>
<p>In its statement, the KSA explained that it will continue to monitor the gambling activities and observe if Blue High House complies. The gambling watchdog reiterated that sanctions such as fines are used to punish any violations of the gambling regulations.</p>
<p>Additionally, the KSA reiterated the importance of using licensed gambling operators. It pointed out that the established strict regulations and rules related to gambling seek to ensure that customers have access to safe legal gambling activities. The KSA added that licensed gambling operators adhere to the regulations that ensure player protection and seek to prevent gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The potential penalty against Blue High House comes after the KSA hit LCS Limited with a $2.2 million fine last week. At the time, the regulator said that the operator offered its services illegally via its www.sonsofslots.com brand. This was not the first violation imposed by the KSA against LCS Limited.</p>
