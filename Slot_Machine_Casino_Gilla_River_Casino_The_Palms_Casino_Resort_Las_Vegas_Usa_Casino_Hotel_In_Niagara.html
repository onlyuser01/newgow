    <h1>Slot Machine Casino Gilla River Casino The Palms Casino Resort Las Vegas Usa Casino Hotel In Niagara</h1>

<p>The second Der Klassiker of the 2021-22 Bundesliga season is on the program on Saturday, April 23. The first Bayern vs Dortmund duel of the season was played at Westfalen Stadium and Bayern won 3-2. This time, Bayern is playing on its own turf (Allianz Arena in Munich) and is expected to win again.</p>
<p>As there are only four rounds left before the end of the season, a win on Saturday would mean winning the title for Bayern. If Die Roten do it, it’s going to be their 10th consecutive Bundesliga-winning season.</p>
<p>Dortmund, on the other hand, still does have a chance to win the 2021-22 title, but for that to happen, the boys in yellow need to win all of their remaining games, as well as see Bayern fail to win even once. It sure looks impossible, but you can be sure Dortmund players are going to try. After all, they got nothing to lose.</p>

<p>Julian Nagelsmann’s Men Need to Win on Saturday</p>
<p>After a shocking end to their Champions League campaign, Bayern’s coach Julian Nagelsmann got into the hot seat. He probably isn’t going to get sacked but the failure to go past Villarreal in the UCL quarterfinal has made fans angry with him.</p>
<p>This goes especially because the 34-year-old manager seemed very confident ahead of the rematch. Unfortunately for him, Bayern drew 1-1 with Villarreal which wasn’t enough to get them to the next phase.</p>
<p>Their consolation comes in the form of the Bundesliga title. Although they’re used to winning this competition, they still have reasons to celebrate, assuming they win it again. That’s what they can do by beating Dortmund at Allianz Arena, enabling their fans to have a Bundesliga party at home.</p>
<p>Dortmund Would Love to Ruin Bayern’s Plans</p>
<p>Dortmund lost the previous seven duels with Bayern. Further, the last time Dortmund won a Bundesliga game against Bayern in Munich was in 2014. That said, it’s obvious that these guys would love to put an end to their horrible run.</p>
<p>A thing that’s giving them confidence is that they’re coming off a 6-1 win over Wolfsburg, in which five different players scored. What needs to worry them, however, is that they got some serious problems with injuries. At least nine of their first-team players will miss Saturday’s game.</p>
<p>The good news is that their best player Erling Haaland isn’t among those. The 21-year-old superstar is fit and in fantastic form. Plus, he’s probably very motivated to show the world what he’s got as several major clubs (Real Madrid, Manchester City, etc.) are looking into the possibility of signing him in the summer.</p>
<p>Bayern Munich vs Dortmund Prediction</p>
<p>Bayern Munich mustn’t fail this time for the sake of its fans. However, Dortmund isn’t going to surrender without a fight. As a result, it’s very likely we’re going to witness an entertaining game, packed with excitement on both ends.</p>
