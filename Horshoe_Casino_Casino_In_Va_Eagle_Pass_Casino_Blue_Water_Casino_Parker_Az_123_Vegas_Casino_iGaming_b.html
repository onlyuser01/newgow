<p>Vita Media Group recently acquired iGaming company Greenplay from the Spanish group Codere Online Management Services. Vita Media plans to increase its market share in Latin America and Europe by incorporating the casino brand into OMG Affiliates, the seventh company to join this unit. Terms of the acquisition have not been revealed.</p>
<p>Vita Media Extends Global Reach</p>
<p>All affiliates who were previously operating on Greenplay Casino under agreements with Codere Online Management Services will be transferred to OMG Affiliates. Vita also explained plans to bring all affiliates into the company’s account management system after the migration.</p>
<p>Jimmi Meilstrup, Vita Media’s CEO and co-founder, stated that the acquisition of Greenplay casino is a “massive expansion” of the company’s iGaming operations. He added, “We are reinventing our presence in existing markets, and at the same time, we are trying to unlock new market possibilities. This strategic investment allows us to be more creative and offer a lot more quality on the market in 2022.”</p>
<p>Vita Media’s Greenplay acquisition marks the third merger of the company in 2021. It had previously purchased Trada Affiliates in the UK and AffiliSearch in Denmark.</p>
<p>Vita described the takeover as strategically important in helping the company diversify its offering and improve its business offerings for iGaming companies.</p>
<p>Codere Undergoing Several Changes</p>
<p>Codere was recently acquired by its shareholders in an arrangement that saw them take control of the company’s operations. It was expected that a restructuring of company assets would follow, with certain subsidiaries and entities once controlled by the company being sold. 2022 is going to see a continued transition of the company.</p>
<p>The Spanish National Securities Exchange Commission (CNMV, for its Spanish acronym) had to suspend Codere from the Bolsa Madrid stock exchange last month. After an extraordinary meeting of shareholders, Codere approved the start of a settlement process to dissolve the company. Codere shareholders then requested the CNMV de-list the company, which took place on December 17.</p>
