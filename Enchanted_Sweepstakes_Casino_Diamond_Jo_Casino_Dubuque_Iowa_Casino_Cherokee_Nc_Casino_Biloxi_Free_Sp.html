<p>15 Dragon Pearls Hold and Win Slot Review</p>
<p>Popular for their well-crafted features, excellent gameplay, and attention to detail, Booongo’s games are a real feast for a large number of slot aficionados worldwide. Combined with popular themes and exciting storylines, the provider’s games are hard to ignore in any online casino lobby. The same goes for 15 Dragon Pearls Hold and Win, the slot that Booongo released in the summer of 2020.</p>
<p>Since its release, 15 Dragon Pearls Hold and Win rapidly turned into another hit game thanks to its top-tier engine and premium Chinese artwork with a solid dragon theme in place. Curious to learn more about the ins and outs of the game? Keep reading!</p>
<p>Theme, Storyline, and Graphics: Let the Hunt for Dragon Pearls Begin</p>
<p>The game allows players to travel back in time and discover some interesting things about Chinese history, tradition, and folklore. As mentioned earlier, 15 Dragon Pearls Hold and Win has an interesting Asian theme in place and it is packed with modern-day game features. The eye-catching aesthetics are built with highly colorful 3D graphics, prevalent violent and gold shades on the reels, and a cool background shaped like an ancient Chinese scroll telling the tale of the rich dragons. In other words, the game has a lot to offer from a design and graphics point of view.</p>
<p>15 Dragon Pearls Hold and Win is therefore packed with plenty of high-definition Chinese elements and symbols including lucky pots of gold, money trees, gold coins, toads, dragons, Yin Yang elements, and others.</p>
<p>Players who are already familiar with games like Supreme Fortune Goddess of the Moon and Supreme Fortune from the same provider may notice a few similarities in regard to the powerful visuals chosen for the game.</p>
<p>15 Dragon Pearls: Game Symbols and Payouts</p>
<p>The low-paying symbols in the game are the standard card values A, K, Q, and J which have been inspired by the intriguing Chinese handwriting style. The Yin Yang elements are the wilds and they are used to form various combinations when visible on the grid in the correct positions. The wilds can land on the reels in piles. To obtain the maximum effect, players must cover the columns with the replacing wild symbols. Wilds cannot, however, substitute feature symbols like bonus and scatter.</p>
<p>The game also introduces 15 Dragon Pearls symbols for a chance to hit an amazing x5000 Grand Jackpot while enjoying the perks of the Bonus Game. Orange pearl symbols along with scatters represented by golden dragons can also pop up while in the base game. Collect a minimum of three scatters on any location on reels three, four, or five and you will get to trigger eight Free Spins.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature only relies on high-value symbols found on the reels, thus completely eliminating the locations of the low-paying symbols. This makes any win a lot more generous and also simpler to form since there are fewer categories of symbols actually competing for the same location. Getting a new set of three scatters automatically retriggers the free spins.</p>
<p>Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The game’s overall design and theme are nicely complemented by engaging Chinese folklore music and interesting sounds that do a great job of elevating the ambiance. When players hit a jackpot or enter a bonus round with free spins, the music becomes even more engaging and the explosive animations consisting of fire imagery and burning flames from the rich dragons take over the grid.</p>
<p>15 Dragon Pearls Gameplay</p>
<p>The gameplay is fast and smooth thanks to the highly intuitive user interface. 15 Dragon Pearls can be easily played on the go as it is completely scalable and compatible with mobile gaming.</p>
<p>The coin levels can be accessed to the right, just beneath the reels, where players are also given the opportunity to use the unlimited autoplay option, check the paytable, play the game at a faster speed, or start playing on the spot hitting the Spin button to the right.</p>
<p>Players can also choose a separate wager instead of simply pressing the available indicators on the screen. The lowest bets begin at $0.25 and they go up incrementally, reaching a maximum of $60 for a single spin. This means the game has the potential of triggering a massive $60,000 payout for a 1000x win.</p>
<p>Free Spins and Bonuses</p>
<p>The slot is particularly interesting when it comes to the amazingly high potential of winning big as introduced by the bonus features. Without a doubt, Booongo has taken the standard gameplay to a whole new level by adding a smart mix of free spins, wild symbols, and a Bonus Game that encompasses a Grand Jackpot.</p>
<p>Free Spins</p>
<p>Players who see a minimum of three money pot symbols (scatters) landing on any position on the second, third, and fourth reels trigger eight free spins. Only special symbols and picture symbols will be visible on the reels, meaning that it is possible to retrigger the free spins as well as the bonus game.</p>
<p>Three scatters seen landing on reels two, three, and four during a Free Spin round will trigger eight more free spins.</p>
<p>Bonus Game</p>
<p>The Bonus Game is triggered during the Free Spins. At least six Orange Pearls symbols are needed to trigger it. All pearls symbols will stick to the reels during the bonus round. Only green, blue, and orange pearls and +1 symbols will show up on the reels during the Bonus Games. The possible values of Orange Pearls symbols range from 1x to 20x. Players who manage to collect all 15 Bonus symbols no matter what type they are receive the spectacular Grand Jackpot worth 5,000x of the total bet.</p>
<p>The Bonus Game is initiated with six respins. +1 symbols popping on the grid bring players one extra respin. The +1 symbol is non-sticking and it vanished during the following respin. When a few +1 symbols appear on the grid, players receive more extra respins. The Bonus Game continues until the respins are over or when all 15 Pearls symbols of all colors are successfully collected.</p>
<p>Once the Bonus Game has ended, the values of all the Pearls symbols are added and the player receives the Bonus Win.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>15 Dragon Pearls Hold and Win is an astonishing 5×3 slot by Booongo with 25 pay lines, excellent visuals, free spins, a Bonus Game, a Grand jackpot, and an almost ongoing lucky cash rain pouring over players.</p>
<p>Players who choose this slot enjoy a fun and lucrative gaming experience while exploring a short part of Chinese history through the immersive soundtrack and animations.</p>
