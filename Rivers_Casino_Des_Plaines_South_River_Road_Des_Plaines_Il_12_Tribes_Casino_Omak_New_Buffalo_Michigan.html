<p>The leading business-to-business (B2B) content and aggregation platform, REEVO, announced it signed a new agreement, allowing it to expand its portfolio of content. The company confirmed that it signed a new content partnership with AvatarUX, the award-winning provider of slot games.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the freshly minted deal, REEVO's partner operators will be able to access popular games from the leading slots studio. Similar to other deals announced by the famous B2B aggregator and platform provider, AvatarUX's complete portfolio of games will be added to REEVO's aggregation platform.</p>
<p>As a result, partners of the fast-growing aggregator will be able to access fan-favorite games from the popular slots studio such as MonkeyPop, as well as Cherry Pop, among others. The agreement comes at a time when strong demand is observed in the popularity of the award-winning MultiPop and PopWins mechanics.</p>
<p>In a statement, AvatarUX's CEO, Nicola Longmuir, shared her excitement about the new collaboration with REEVO. "We’re very pleased to partner with REEVO and add our portfolio of top-performing content to its ever-growing aggregation offering," she said. Finally, Longmuir pointed out: "We’re in a period of strong commercial growth and partnerships like these allow us to expand our distribution to new markets and target new players."</p>
<p>Petra Maria Poola, REEVO's Head of Sales, was similarly delighted about the new collaboration and explained that the famous PopWins games from AvatarUX enabled the provider to stand out from the competition and deliver unique experiences. "Our customers will love getting access to this premium content, and we’re delighted to confirm this partnership with one of the brightest brands in iGaming," explained Poola in conclusion.</p>
<p>Recently, REEVO expanded its portfolio of partners by teaming up with Endorphina, a provider of thrilling slot games. Announced back in June, the collaboration enabled the iGaming provider to reach new customers via REEVO's extensive partner network. Per that deal, Endorphina agreed to provide a plethora of cutting-edge games to REEVO's aggregation platform.</p>
<p>Before that, earlier in June, the B2B content and aggregation platform signed an agreement with Onlyplay, a fast-growing provider of games for the online gambling sector. That deal saw REEVO tap into new games, including crash, slots and instant win titles, among others.</p>
<p>Currently, REEVO offers more than 8,000 games from more than 70 iGaming providers. The platform's vast offering includes table and slot games, as well as crash and live dealer titles. Constantly growing, REEVO continues to expand its portfolio of partners.</p>
