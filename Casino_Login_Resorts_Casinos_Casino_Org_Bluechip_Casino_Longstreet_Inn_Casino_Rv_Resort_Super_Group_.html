    <h1>Casino Login Resorts Casinos Casino Org Bluechip Casino Longstreet Inn Casino Rv Resort Super Group</h1>

<p>On Monday, Super Group confirmed the proposed sale of DGC’s non-core B2B division to the leading provider of content for the iGaming industry that has a growing portfolio of more than 200 partners around the world, Games Global.</p>
<p>It was only recently that Super Group expanded its global presence by acquiring DGC. As a result, the company tapped into a dozen US states including eight where DGC is already live. This marked a major step for Super Group, as the company expanded its US-facing presence with an already established operator.</p>
<p>Now, according to the latest announcement, DGC is looking forward to completing the sale of its B2B division at some point during the second half of 2023. The company’s B2B division already has a well-established presence in the US, considering it is licensed and operates in major markets such as New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Within those markets, the division already delivers gaming content to some of the leading gambling operators.</p>
<p>The Sale Will Enable Super Group to Focus On B2C Operations</p>
<p>Walter Bugno, Games Global’s CEO, said that the takeover of DGC’s B2B division represents a unique opportunity for the company. He explained that thanks to this acquisition, Games Global would be able to expand within the continuously growing iGaming market around the US. Last but not least, Bugno said: “Such a positive move will enable us to access some of the best operators in the sector and provide a fantastic platform from which to leverage our portfolio of over 50 partner studios, more than 3,000 proprietary games and a record-breaking progressive jackpot network, including Mega Moolah and Wow Pot, which have paid out over 1.5 billion euros since inception.”</p>
<p>“Disposing of DGC’s B2B division makes commercial sense and will allow us to continue to focus solely on our B2C growth in the United States.“ Neal Menashe, CEO of Super Group</p>
<p>Neal Menashe, Super Group’s CEO, added that by selling DGC’s B2B division, the company will be able to focus on expanding further its business-to-customer (B2C) operations in the US. He pointed out that Super Group has benefited from leading content delivered by Games Global for years. Menashe added that this is a prime reason why the company considers that DGC’s B2B division “will be in great hands.”</p>
<p>The recent sale doesn’t come as a surprise, considering Super Group’s plan to focus further on B2C operations. Currently, the company holds multiple licenses and operates in some of the leading markets across the Americas, Europe, as well as Africa.</p>
