<p>International Game Technology, a multinational gambling company that produces slot machines and other gambling technology, has expanded its US footprint by launching its content in West Virginia.</p>
<p>IGT Launched In a Fifth State</p>
<p>Gambling operators in the Mountain State can now benefit from IGT’s premium suite of PlayCasino gambling content, which includes a large variety of thematic games. Following the deal, operators can add IGT titles to their platforms, allowing their customers to play critically-acclaimed games such as Cleopatra, Fortune Coin, Siberian Storm, and Ultimate X Poker.</p>
<p>IGT’s content can be played online and even supports mobile gambling, providing bettors with a high degree of flexibility.</p>
<p>West Virginia is now the fifth US jurisdiction where IGT’s offerings are available. The company offers its state-of-the-art iGaming titles to numerous regulated markets across the world and is keen on expanding in the key North American market. IGT recently reinforced its foothold in Washington by inking a multi-year partnership with the Kalispel Tribe. The company has been enjoying tons of successes and scored a record income in 2021, surpassing $900 million.</p>
<p>Gil Rotem, the president of iGaming at IGT, spoke about the expansion of the company’s footprint. He said that West Virginia presents an incredible opportunity to assert IGT’s leadership by providing superb PlayCasino content to local bettors. Rotem emphasized his company’s experience in providing iGaming content and platform technologies to operators across the world and is convinced that the Mountain State launch is going to be a huge success.</p>
<p>Rotem added that IGT’s PlayDigital brand is a decorated iGaming provider, known to gamblers across the United States. Thanks to this, IGT’s president is sure that his company’s content will help gambling operators in West Virginia maximize player engagement and meet the customers’ demand for digital gaming content.</p>
<p>IGT is one of the biggest gambling content providers. It is based in London and has over 10,500 employees. The company’s reach is wide as its varied iGaming offerings are available in over a hundred markets.</p>
<p>A few days ago, IGT inked a deal with Orenes Grupo, agreeing to develop and distribute advanced salon gambling content to bettors in Spain. Prior to that, the company extended its contract with Mexico’s national lottery operator, La Lotería Nacional, agreeing to power it with premium solutions until 2024. In February, IGT penned yet another agreement extension, agreeing to continue working with the Rhode Island Lottery for 20 more years.</p>
