    <h1>Casino Games Free Online Winstar Online Casino Login Dania Casino Casino Florence Oregon Hotels Near</h1>

<p>Recently, I signed up to Cafe Casino after a girl in our neighborhood gave me a flyer for a special offer if i made sure to list her as my referrer.</p>
<p>I deposited money using bitcoin to get the highest deposit bonus which was 350%. I played for a couple fairly lengthy sessions, and i had finally decided to quit, and realized that I had cleared the required rollover, and had $750 remaining in my account.</p>
<p>I requested a withdrawal, at which point, i was directed to submit identification information. I submitted my drivers licenese, a selfie with my license, and bank statement to the Casino. Obviously I expected that my withdrawal would be processed as soon as they received it and didnt think much more of it.</p>
<p>The following morning, I received notification that my account had been temporarily disabled while an investigation into my account took place. My $600 withdrawal was not processed, and my access to the account and my remaining funds was cut off.</p>
<p>I was absolutely furious because going into this thing, I felt like online casinos were just out to screw people over. Whether it be unfair gaming odds or not paying out, etc. And sure enough, thats exactly what happened.</p>
<p>I have now waited 5 days, and have had no further communication whatsoever from the Casino, and i just think its absolute garbage. Ive looked over the rules to see if i did something that was not allowed, and nothing. Im just a normal guy who signed up, spent money, and is now getting treated like a piece of trash. Hoping someone can help get this resolved. When ive reached back out to the support, they tell me that ill receive an email when the investigation is concluded. What is that? Such a bad way to do business.</p>
<p>I dont know if they have me confused with someone or what, but I could certainly resolve whatever issue they have if someone would simply speak to me and allow me the opportunity to clarify any misunderstanding going on. I just dont know what the issue could possibly be</p>
