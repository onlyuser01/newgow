    <h1>Php Bonus Online Casino Casino In Montgomery Al Ohio Casinos Casino Mine Ranch Oak Grove Casino Play</h1>

<p>On April 7th I was playing the Lucky Bank Robbers game by Belatra Games and I noticed that an spade icon on the left hand side of the screen with a red dot on it. I clicked on the icon and it opened a new screen that said play and win. Several games were listed on this screen and Lucky Bank Robbers play and win game was one of them. I clicked on the game and it opened. After a few spins I got 3 reels of credits which initiated the bonus. During the bonus round you are given 3 additional spins which resets if you get more credits on the remaining reels. After a few rounds in the bonus, the entire screen had filled with credits. The screen started shaking and playing music and jackpot flashed across the screen. It said congradulations you won the gold reserve jackpot of $51,127.91 and coins started falling all over the screen. Then the screen changed to a cheque that said $51,127.91 and it was signed by Belatra Games. A red button appeared beneath the cheque and it said collect. The screen changed back to the normal game and then it awarded the credits to my remaining credits and then the game froze. I refreshed my browser. Same thing happened. It replayed the bonus win and awarded the credits again and then froze. I cleared my cookies, logged out, logged in same thing. I contacted customer service and they said they cpuldnt see the win on their end only that i had an unfinished bet. I sent them screenshots of my win. They said they would have to forward the ticket to tech support. The next day i contacted my vip manager who also promised to contact tech support and had me fill out this form to ezplain exactly what happened. A few daya ago i get an email from the vip manager saying all wins were paid out. Thats is crazy. I was never paid put for anything. To this day the game remains frozen to when i won the jackpot yet they are telling me that i didnt win? I have proof that i won. I have screenshots and video from the win. I did not make these images up.</p>
