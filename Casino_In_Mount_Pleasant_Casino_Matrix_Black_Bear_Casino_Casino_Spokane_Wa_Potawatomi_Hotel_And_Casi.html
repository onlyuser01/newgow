    <h1>Casino In Mount Pleasant Casino Matrix Black Bear Casino Casino Spokane Wa Potawatomi Hotel And Casi</h1>

<p>I wish to complain and at the same warn people away from Betonic.com</p>
<p>Betonic has a rule of 48 hours to complete going over and approving withdrawals.</p>
<p>I have now waited more than 96 hours and every single attempt to get assistance from Live Chat has only resulted in the same answer from every rep. Also, the reps are rude and show no interest, initiative or motivation to help. When I have tried to get more info they simply close the chat on you.</p>
<p>The following is an example of the answer I get everytime:</p>
<p>At 11:42:46 February 14th representative Lexi wrote:</p>
<p>Regarding your pending payout, I can state that our relevant department has been informed about the request and is working to process the transaction as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience, please give us a little more time to complete the process.</p>
<p>No matter how I try....I cannot get any help or assistance from the people that are supposed to do so.</p>
<p>I have also send several emails to support@betonic.com. I have not received one single response.</p>
<p>So, my issue is that I cannot get my funds and not one person in the service departments tries to help me resolvetheproblem.</p>
<p>All other casinos usually pay out winnings instantly. And service usially exceptional. I have never ever dealt with a casino that shows as much disinterest in helping their customers. I had spent over â‚¬12.000 on the 11th and when I decide to withdraw about 21% of my winnings they are being withheld for on unaccabtable amount of time breaking betonic's own rules.</p>
<p>I would also like to warn people not to accept bonus offers from Betonic.com. The reason being that the terms and conditions are so complicated and favor betonic totally. The betting requirements are outrageous and they try and cheat you of your money through these bonuses. Please read the customer reviews here about betonic and that will explain.</p>
