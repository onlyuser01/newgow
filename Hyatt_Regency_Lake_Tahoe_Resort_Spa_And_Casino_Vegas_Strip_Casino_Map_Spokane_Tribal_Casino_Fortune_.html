<p>Pragmatic Play has strengthened its partnership with Betsson with the supplier confirming that it will deliver a dedicated Spanish-language live roulette game for Betsafe, one of the group’s brands.</p>
<p>This partnershipis important for both Betsson Group and Pragmatic Play, as both companies are looking to continue expanding in the Latin American market, and this collaboration would allow them to achieve just that.</p>
<p>Betsson is now in a position to power its Betsafe brand with one of the most well-established live casino roulette variations, courtesy of Pragmatic Play. As a whole, Pragmatic Play has been shaping up as a familiar name in the Latin American region where the studio has been striking a succession of partnerships and where its products have been well-received.</p>
<p>The company’s roulette game is flexible and easily customizable which makes it perfect for branded environments and thus gives Betsafe and Betsson Group an even stronger presence in the targeted markets. Betsafe too is a brand that has been building up its own footprint in the region and has already been a known name to local players.</p>
<p>To remain so and continue to grow, Betsafe needs to keep adding to its variety of games and products. Pragmatic Games’ products stand out with strong recognition among local audiences thanks to their cutting-edge tech that underpins the gaming experience.</p>
<p>Commenting on this fresh opportunity, Betsson Group Commercial Director of Southern Europe and LatAm Andrea Rossi said:</p>
<p>"Pragmatic Play’s Live Casino customizable branding has already proven a hit across our operator estate, and we are delighted to bring it to our Betsafe customers."</p>
<p>Rossi said that Betsson Group was confident that local audiences and Betsafe players will enjoy the immersive roulette experience that Pragmatic Play is going to inject directly into the platform.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Chief Operating Officer Irina Cornides was similarly pleased with the opportunity to see this new collaboration between the companies. She said that a localized roulette experience is a powerful combination that is bound to benefit the Betsson Group brand and help its players enjoy one of their favorite games in a more intuitive and entertaining environment.</p>
<p>As to Pragmatic Play’s own presence in the region, Cornides noted that the company has gone from strength to strength and it was excited to provide Betsafe with a bespoke branded roulette experience. Pragmatic Play recently strengthened the iGaming offering of other partner operators, including Fortune Coins and the Finnish gaming monopoly, Veikkaus.</p>
