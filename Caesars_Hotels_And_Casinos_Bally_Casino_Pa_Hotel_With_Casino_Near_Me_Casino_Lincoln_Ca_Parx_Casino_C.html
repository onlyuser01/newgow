    <h1>Caesars Hotels And Casinos Bally Casino Pa Hotel With Casino Near Me Casino Lincoln Ca Parx Casino C</h1>

<p>I forgot to say my last post that for the first 3 days they were saying that my crypto address was not a valid crypto address. The day before yesterday my reply and email not only had the crypto address in it but had a screenshot of the QR code to my crypto address to where if the text version my crypto address was not sufficient then I figured they could use the QR code and talking to support and game and then acknowledging that okay my crypto address is valid it's just not a 34 character one. So now the last email is no longer calling my crypto address a non-valid crypto address it's just saying I need to have a 34 character crypto address that they will not accept before you two character one and I've gone over there terms and conditions on withdrawals bonus play everything there is to go over when it pertains to withdraws and player accounts and even deposits nowhere does it say anything about requiring and it being mandatory to have a 34 character crypto address in order to receive withdrawals. And if I could I'd make a deposit from my crypto address right now to show that they'll accept a deposit from crypto address that's more than 34 characters.</p>
<p>I just thought I'd add that that they've gone from calling it invalid crypto address to now acknowledging that it's a valid crypto address just not a 34 character one as their reason for holding up and stalling on my withdrawal.</p>
