<p>The Kentucky Lottery and International Game Technology have announced a groundbreaking partnership that will see the two companies continue to collaborate through 2036, a 13-year extension of their current contract, which will result in significant enhancement of the lottery’s current offer, and strengthen IGT’s own standing in the Bluegrass State.</p>
<p>IGT will move forward with an upgrade of the Lottery’s central system, ensuring that the lottery has tighter control over operations and can elicit strong business results in future. The companies have agreed to integrate the Aurora platform which will be featured across the 3,400 lottery retailers, along with an iLottery system and cloud integration.</p>
<p>Both companies have been welcoming of this new opportunity, and they have been actively building up on their relationship which started back in 2016, when the Kentucky Lottery was among the supplier’s first clients. Aurora is developed as a player-centric and omnichannel experience that fits nicely with what the lottery is trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Essentially, the platform is designed to drive innovation and profitability, and it utilizes user-friendly tools and has powerful reporting capabilities to ensure that partner businesses benefit from the system. Aurora also comes with upgraded security and dynamic scalability, which makes it easier for partners to scale up their offer if and when needed.</p>
<p>Kentucky Lottery Corporation President &amp; CEO Mary R. Harville welcomed this opportunity and said that the partnership would allow the lottery to significantly modernize its capabilities and operations.</p>
<p>"Enhancing our lottery solutions with IGT's retail and iLottery systems and convenient self-service retail terminals will provide more opportunities for us to responsibly grow our sales and return additional funds for scholarships and grants for Kentucky college students," Harville added.</p>
<p>IGT COO Global Lottery Jay Gendron was similarly excited about the opportunity to see his company continue on this path with Kentucky Lottery, a partner that was clearly committed to innovating its product and continuing to modernise it as consumer and market trends demand. Gendron assured that IGT has a future-forward thinking that helps it build products which in turn are critical for the success of partners in various markets, and Kentucky is no exception.</p>
<p>Last but not least, IGT SVP Global iLottery Srini Nedunuri highlighted some of the success achieved by the collaboration so far, including the tripling of the number of online draw games available to players locally.</p>
<p>IGT recently improved its 2023 S&amp;P Global Corporate Sustainability score, with the company recognized for its efforts in environmental, social and governance.</p>
