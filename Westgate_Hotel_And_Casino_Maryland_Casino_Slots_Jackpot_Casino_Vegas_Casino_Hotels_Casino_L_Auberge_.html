    <h1>Westgate Hotel And Casino Maryland Casino Slots Jackpot Casino Vegas Casino Hotels Casino L Auberge</h1>

<p>With my online gambling experiences which takes me back 30 somewhat years when I used to play on dial up to how amazingly fast online casinos have come. With all these advances, some casino which Im not going to name any names takes weeks to pay out, some within hours and some instantly within minutes. Let talk about the weeks of processing to approval to finally reaching you. Some of these casino say deposit with crypto and you withdraw will be faster, which is somewhat true but not really. I spoke to customer support asking what is the process time with crypto, they said up to 7 business days to review your withdraw and up to 2 weeks to send out becaue they use an outside source to process the payments. My experiences, the fastest I received my winning was 2 weeks, longest was almost 2 months.</p>
<p>The casinos with instant withdraw meaning within minutes not instant. I notice those casinos are very tight and limits how much you can win. Im sure there are those who do win big but I dont think there are much.</p>
<p>There are those wonderful casinos that process within 24 hrs which all my experiences has been under 12 hrs most cases. They offer the same deposit methods and cashout methods as the casinos that takes weeks. I notice these casinos dont really offer too much bonuses tho but they do give incentives for logging in everyday. I think they dont offer too many bonus because they dont need to. Players come there to play because of the games the quick withdraw process which I think is SSSSSOOOOOO key and because have won big one time or another and withdrew it.</p>
<p>See my theory is the long wait is they know most of us are degenerate compulsive gamblers who can not wait that long so we reverse our withdraws to lose it back. Thats smart but also mean uses the tricks to lure you in but wont let you leave with your winnings. I experience winning over 10-20 thousands dollar to never be able to withdraw because of this long wait. Im not saying its their fault but they know us and they know how to make us lose it back. The thing is I would probably lose it back anyways because everyone goes back to where they won and gamble loosing most back but at least we would be able to use a lil for something else. I understand that their ultimate point is to take our money but dont be so greedy that you use tricks to get more. Thats my experiences and of course its my opinion Im sharing. Tell me your stories and your thoughts.</p>
