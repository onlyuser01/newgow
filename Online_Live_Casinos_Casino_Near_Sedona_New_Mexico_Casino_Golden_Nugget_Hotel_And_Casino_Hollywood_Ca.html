<p>The National Council on Problem Gambling has strengthened its responsible gambling efforts by adding theScore as a premium partner.</p>
<p>TheScore Becomes Premium NCPG Partner</p>
<p>Score Media and Gaming Inc. has entered into a partnership with the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) through its subsidiary Score Digital Sports Ventures Inc. which is better known under the theScore Bet brand name.</p>
<p>The decision signals the company’s unambiguous position on responsible gambling and commitment to upholding consumer protection standards at a time when theScore Bet is rapidly expanding its mobile offer across North America.</p>
<p>As the leading national organization tasked with protecting and treating gambling addiction and assisting affected families and individuals, the NCPG has been looking to establish closer ties with leading betting and gaming firms.</p>
<p>TheScore’s Platinum Membership will help the NCPG boost public awareness of gambling addiction as well as make it possible for affected individuals to seek and get help for any gambling-related disorders that may manifest in them or their families.</p>
<p>Boosting Gambling Addiction Awareness</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest tie-up, theScore General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, Josh Sidsworth, noted that the NCPG was an important voice in championing responsible gambling and ensuring the safest possible experience, something theScore was one hundred percent behind. He further had this to say:</p>
<p>“Partnering with the NCPG further deepens our commitment to responsible gaming, providing valuable resources as legal mobile sports betting and iGaming continue to grow across North America.” -theScore General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, Josh Sidsworth</p>
<p>Responding to the partnership, NCPG Executive Director Keith Whyte has welcomed the membership, arguing that the addition of theScore has been a tremendous asset for the organization. TheScore’s broad reach and commitment to responsible gambling translates into the opportunity to raise awareness for problem gambling and mobilize additional resources, Whyte noted.</p>
<p>In the meantime, theScore remains fully committed to the NCPG’s efforts as outlined in the non-profit organization’s Safer Sports Betting Initiative and Internet Responsible Gambling Standards. TheScore has been expanding its footprint actively across the United States.</p>
<p>Specifically, the company launched its mobile app in Colorado in September and teamed up with Twin River in New Jersey.</p>
