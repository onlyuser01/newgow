    <h1>Belle Terra Casino Zia Park Casino Hotel Racetrack Hobbs Nm Online Casino Bonus Ohne Einzahlung Sand</h1>

<p>Hi, today (11.11.2021) I recevied, without warning or prior notice, a email that betregal had canceled all my funds due to expiration of time. I have not been able to log into my betregal account since March of 2020 as they have frozen my account. I do not know why, but my account there is frozen. This email is the first time they have reached out to me since then. I have always had to be ask in live chat of what document they needed next or what bank details they needed to send my funds or other details. It has been an extremly frustration prosess as a customer all along the way.</p>
<p>I have never known why my account is frozen, but betregal has since March 2020 requested a norotial notice, which I have declined to send them due to the covid pandemic. I would not risk going to go to the inner city and court house and expose my self to potensial infection as I am part of the risk group. I could die if I get this virus. So I waited to this fall as the covid situation in my country is under controll and we have vaccsines. So one month ago I got what betregal asked for, a noterial notice. I sent it to them. It was approved and I sent them my bank details that same week. They had all they needed to send my funds.</p>
<p>A month later I recevied this email in norwegain (you can enter the email it into google translate to get the gist of it):</p>
<p>"Kjære Ludvig,</p>
<p>Takk for at du kontakter oss på Betregal</p>
<p>Vær oppmerksom på at midlene gikk tapt på grunn av utløp. Du vil dessverre ikke motta flere midler.</p>
<p>Skulle du ha ytterligere spørsmål, vennligst ikke nøl med å komme til LIVE CHAT eller send oss en epost fra Kontakt oss siden.</p>
<p>Vennlig hilsen,</p>
<p>Keith</p>
<p>Kontoansvarlig Betregal "</p>
<p>I find this deeply unfair as I have always tried to verify my account and given them all the documents they have asked. I have given them my bank details. I have talked to live chat for hours upon hours to get updates and progress, but betregal has netiher been helpful or solution oriented. Now the have deleted my funds because they have used long time handle my account. I should not be punished for betregals slowness. This is my hard earned money and I should not pay for the casinos mistakes. I ask of betregal and casinoguru to help me solve this case. Have a plesant day.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Ludvig</p>
