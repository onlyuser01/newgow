<p>hi Daniel,well it is now 5 weeks ago that i requested my payout .they do not respond to emails or chat were they close it immidiatly.matter of fact my ip adress is blocked for the chat ,if i use vpn i can see the chat .2 weeks ago i requested acount closure and suddenly all support were keen to tell me that my withdrawal would be not processed because i closed my acoung .then i reopend it again and since then no replays in emails or chat .now they added in payment history (withdrawal)to my cash out if i press on it i get a popup saying withdrawal confirmation and it requests to fill in my payment informatio over and over again.i sent in all information by email and chat no one respond .first 2 weeks i was told to wait 5 dsys because it was sent to payment department .all lies .i requested a statement and it woulld be send to me 5 weeks later still nothing .this is not how you treat customers .i did not found them they invited me to join at this casino.today i reached to chat same guy Adam asked him to close my acount it was done in seconds .i am trying to forget it but it is hard because i won it fairly you know.!for me is this theft .they do not even respond to my complaint here on CG.i had 3 cashouts in this casino second one was payed out 720€ third one i cancelled it 480€ and played it away i knew they would not pay me if i won .first on requested on 25 mei 1031€ is still processing .i dont believe it .they want me to deposit only .maybe i was only winning on there sister site and this one and are trying to get ridd of me .because i only play real live tables they cant alter the rtp .</p>
