    <h1>Casino Extreme No Deposit Bonus Bwin Casino Buffet At Hollywood Casino Las Vegas Casinos Hotels Casi</h1>

<p>The company's strategic expansion is possible thanks to a recent acquisition of a Maltese company that has a license in Italy</p>
<p>The business-to-business (B2B) casino and sportsbook platform provider, delivering reliable and seamless solutions and services to the online gambling sector, Soft2Bet, announced it continues its expansion across Europe. The company revealed Wednesday that it will expand into the Italian gambling market. This expansion, Soft2Bet confirms, is possible thanks to its recent acquisition of a Maltese company that holds an Italian license.</p>
<p>Lauded as a strategic move, the expansion of the company in Italy complements its plans for growth. Increasing its footprint in the country, Soft2Bet’s leading services and products will be able to reach new partners. At the same time, this collaboration complements the company’s European and global growth.</p>
<p>Recently, Soft2Bet expanded further its European footprint by securing a license in Greece. Last month, the company revealed that it was awarded a B2B A1 license from the Greek gambling regulator, the Hellenic Gaming Commission. This marked an important achievement for the company, allowing it to further grow its presence in the region and engage with new partners for this important market.</p>
<p>The Company Is Thrilled to Continue to Expand across Europe</p>
<p>Considering Soft2Bet’s strategic expansion in Italy, the company confirmed it will work closely with the country’s online gambling regulator, the Agenzia delle Dogane e dei Monopoli (ADM). This collaboration will seek to ensure that the company’s operations are in line with the established gambling regulations and laws.</p>
<p>Additionally, Soft2Bet hinted that it plans to certify its platform in Italy, allowing it to deliver its exceptional services to new customers. Above all, the leading iGaming B2B provider said that it wants to become a leading platform provider for the region, powering the operations of gambling companies.</p>
<p>“We at Soft2Bet are happy to deepen our European presence with this exciting venture into the Italian market.“ David Yatom Hay, general counsel at Soft2Bet</p>
<p>David Yatom Hay, Soft2Bet’s general counsel, revealed that the company is delighted to continue to expand its footprint on the Old Continent. He explained that its venture into the Italian market represents “another example of Soft2Bet’s steadfast commitment to expand its regulatory portfolio.” Finally, Hay predicted that operators in the country will benefit from Soft2Bet’s quality services and portfolio.</p>
