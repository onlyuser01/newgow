<p>The NeoGames subsidiary has brought in a new director of partnerships to help bolster its reach and strike new and meaningful relationships</p>
<p>Pariplay will now see Ashley Bloor steer the company’s expansion efforts in securing new clients in Europe and North America, as well as beyond. As a professional, Bloor has more than ten years of experience working for prominent companies, including as head of operations for RGS at EveryMatrix, William Hill, bet365, Gala Coral, and Gaming Innovation Group.</p>
<p>Pariplay Brings More Expertise to Bolster Expansion</p>
<p>Bloor will leverage the power of the Ignite and Fusion brands and their product offerings, which are designed in such a way as to make it easier for Pariplay to strike new partnerships and maximize the value and efficiency of such partnerships.</p>
<p>Pariplay is also doubling down on its North American footprint, which means that Bloor will be tasked with the company’s regional growth there. Pariplay CCO welcomed the appointment of Bloor. Enrico Bradamate said:</p>
<p>We are thrilled to welcome Ashley to the team and know she will play a crucial part as we execute our growth strategy and expand our global partner network of studios and operators, cementing our position as the number one gaming aggregator. Pariplay CCO Enrico Bradamate</p>
<p>Pariplay’s own Bloor was similarly pleased with the partnership opportunity and added that she was looking forward to assuming her new responsibility and further developing existing relationships as she builds new ones.</p>
<p>“look forward to building on our existing partnerships and creating new synergies as we continue on this journey,” Bloor stated. Pariplay has been building up its footprint methodically in the meantime. The company teamed up with Galaxsys, signing a distribution deal with the supplier. Pariplay similarly did not miss its chance to secure and expand its reach in Sweden, securing a B2B license.</p>
<p>The company also integrated Wizard Games with Caesars in Ontario, Canada and is constantly on the lookout for new opportunities to bolster its global footprint.</p>
