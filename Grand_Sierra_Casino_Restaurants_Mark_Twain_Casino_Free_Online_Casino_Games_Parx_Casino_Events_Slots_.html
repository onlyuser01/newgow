<p>Canadian-based Score Media and Gaming Inc. announced Wednesday its subsidiary Score Digital Sports Ventures which operates theScore Bet brand entered Colorado sports betting market by launching its mobile app and sports book. The Centennial State becomes the second US jurisdiction for the operator, after New Jersey, where theScore Bet launched last year.</p>
<p>Partnership with Jacobs Entertainment</p>
<p>The company gained market access to offer mobile sports betting in Colorado via a previously announced agreement with Gilpin Casino, a subsidiary of US-based gaming operator Jacobs Entertainment. theScore Bet is going to continue its expansion across regulated US markets by the upcoming launch in Indiana, where market access has been gained via an agreement with Penn National Gaming.</p>
<p>“The passionate sports fans of Colorado are going to love theScore Bet and we’re thrilled to begin our multi-state rollout here, right in time for football season.” John Levy, Founder and CEO, theScore Bet</p>
<p>Sports fans in Colorado will have pre- and in-game betting options across all major sports leagues and events, and a comprehensive variety of bet types, with the focus being on football, as theScore Bet intends on paving its own way by taking a different approach to reach punters than other competitor operators in the sports wagering landscape.</p>
<p>“The way we’ve uniquely fused media with gaming delivers a totally unrivaled product for fans, unlike anything else in market today. theScore is already the sports app of choice for a huge number of fans in Colorado, and we’re confident theScore Bet is going to quickly become their favorite sportsbook too.” John Levy, Founder and CEO, theScore Bet</p>
<p>The Score would not deploy flashy media partnerships and nonstop commercials and sponsorships as it already has a solid customer base in the state. According to data provider Comscore, theScore Bet app has had the second most average unique visits per month from December 2018 to February 2020, falling behind only ESPN.</p>
<p>“We joke that in the U.S. we’re the least known, most used sports brand in the business.” John Levy, Founder and CEO, theScore Bet</p>
<p>What initially started as a public channel with a ticker of the latest sport scores grew into a TV network that continued to grow and provide general sports and now organic betting and gambling content, having been acquired by the telecommunications company Rogers in 2012. Unlike its biggest competitors in the online sports betting arena, theScore integrated betting to its already content arm, avoiding the need for any partnerships or lavish deals and arrangements.</p>
<p>“We’re a sports media company first. So it’s not just about the betting. We’re not out there doing the big, splashy deals that everyone else is doing, like the other big media companies are doing.” John Levy, Founder and CEO, theScore Bet</p>
<p>According to estimates, $17.3 billion in revenue would be generated annually provided that all 50 states regulate sports betting. Canadians wager $14 billion per year on illegal, unregulated sports betting, and what theScore Bet seeks to achieve is to grab and hold onto a big chunk of this market, as Levy is convinced he has the winning formula going forward.</p>
