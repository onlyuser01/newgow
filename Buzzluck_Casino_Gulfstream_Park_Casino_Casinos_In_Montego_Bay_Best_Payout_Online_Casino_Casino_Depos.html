    <h1>Buzzluck Casino Gulfstream Park Casino Casinos In Montego Bay Best Payout Online Casino Casino Depos</h1>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>on 09/14/22 I made a deposit of €100.00 and received a 100% bonus. So I had €200.00 to play with. It was clear to me from the start that there are games that I am not allowed to use with my bonus, otherwise I would endanger a possible payout. With the game - Chaos Crew- I won €3,706.92 and had a total of €3,900.31 in my account balance. Then I played down to €3,700 in different games (see photo screenshot). Then I had the amount paid out. I still had €100.00 real money (as it said there) available on my game status. The bonus of 100% (€100.00) was deducted from me and my deposited €100.00 was still left in my casino account to play with. Thus, €3,500 was requested as a payout and was no longer displayed in the game account. So I assumed that the payout was secured. So I continued to play with my remaining €100.00 real money the same day. Among other things, then also games that I was not allowed to play with a bonus such. B. Rise of Olympus - I never got a message that I was not allowed to play this game (pop-up message when bonus was used). So I didn't think anything of it and gambled my own - obviously - €100.00 down to €0.00. In the night from 09/14/22 to 09/15/22 I received an e-mail from the casino that my payout was rejected because I had played games with bonus money that were not allowed to be played (T&amp;Cs and bonus rules). But I didn't do that either and emailed the casino directly in the morning - unfortunately without success, because I was only ever made aware of the terms and conditions and I was told several times that I had broken the rules and the payment is rejected. I have explained my procedure several times and also attached screenshots of my game progress (see also here). Eventually, I didn't get any reply via email. I couldn't reach the casino by phone, so I started a chat - this was simply ended by a long discussion and I started it again. Unfortunately also not effective but again and again the reference to the terms and conditions and the bonus rules / guidelines. I have definitely complied with this. I have never violated the rules, guidelines or T&amp;Cs with the mixture of mine and bonus money, not even after the big win as described above. To date, I have not received any useful explanation from the casino as to why I am not being paid out the €3,500 and of course I have never received the amount either. Even a few weeks ago I had problems with the payout of €200 and had to wait several weeks for the payout - documents were constantly missing... I am urgently asking for help here because I don't know how to proceed or what options I have have to get the money.</p>
<p>Warm greetings,</p>
