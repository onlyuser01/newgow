<p>NFC Betting Preview: Super Bowl or Bust for the Philadelphia Eagles</p>
<p>Posted on: September 5, 2023, 11:39h.</p>
<p>Last updated on: September 5, 2023, 02:02h.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Eagles are the consensus favorite to win the NFC Championship in consecutive seasons at +250 odds. The Eagles, San Francisco 49ers, and Dallas Cowboys are the top betting favorites by the public heading into the start of the regular season.</p>

<p>The top-heavy NFC is not as strong as the AFC this season. The AFC has three legit contenders and a handful of other teams gunning for the conference championship and a spot in the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>2023 NFC Championship Odds</p>
<p>Team Odds Philadelphia Eagles +250 San Francisco 49ers +380 Dallas Cowboys +600 Detroit Lions +1100 New Orleans Saints +1200 Seattle Seahawks +1400 Minnesota Vikings +2000 Atlanta Falcons +2200 New York Giants +2800 Chicago Bears +3000 Green Bay Packers +3500 Washington Commanders +4000 Los Angeles Rams +4500 Carolina Panthers +5000 Tampa Bay Bucs +6500 Arizona Cardinals +20000</p>
<p>Two of the top teams in the NFC reside in the same division. The NFC East sent three teams to the playoffs last season, and none of the teams had a losing record. The Eagles and Cowboys will be jockeying for an NFC East division title, with the #1 seed potentially on the line.</p>
<p>Contenders: Eagles, 49ers</p>
<p>The Eagles are +650 odds to win the Super Bowl, and they’re on a mission to return to the big game and secure another championship for the City of Brotherly Love. It could be a difficult task after head coach Nick Sirianni said goodbye to two close confidants and trusted assistant coaches. The Eagles lost their offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator, who both accepted head coaching jobs this season.</p>
<p>The 49ers look to bounce back from a disappointing exit in last year’s playoffs. They lost multiple starting quarterbacks last season because of injuries. Third-string quarterback Brock Purdy, the last pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, led the 49ers to two playoff victories. Purdy tore the UCL in his right elbow in the first quarter of the NFC Championship. Without any viable 49ers options at QB, the Eagles easily defeated San Francisco 31-7 to win the NFC title and punch their ticket to the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Eager Beavers: Lions, Saints, Cowboys</p>
<p>The Cowboys are trying to win one more title for Jerry Jones before the grizzled owner rides off into the sunset. Head coach Mike McCarthy takes over play-calling duties, which is a polarizing nuance heading into this season. The Cowboys parted ways with offensive coordinator Kellen Moore after they scored just 12 points in last postseason’s elimination game.</p>
<p>The Detroit Lions are a team on the rise as they attempt to win their first division title in 30 years. Head coach Dan Campbell is trying to prove that the Lions deserve to be in consideration for the NFC Championship, but oddsmakers are reticent with Jared Goff at quarterback, which is why they’re +1100 odds.</p>
<p>The New Orleans Saints are the best team in a weak NFC South, and they look to return to the playoffs for the first time since future Hall of Fame quarterback Drew Brees retired.</p>
<p>Pretenders: Vikings</p>
<p>The Minnesota Vikings and quarterback Kirk Cousins won a lot of close games last season, so their 13-4 record was a bit deceiving. They were exposed in the postseason when they were picked off by the New York Giants. Oddsmakers and bettors are expecting the Vikings to retreat this season with a win total of 8.5 over/under. The Vikings are in the middle of the road at +2000 odds to win the NFC Championship.</p>
<p>Bubble Trouble: Giants, Seahawks, Falcons</p>
<p>Oddsmakers expect the Seattle Seahawks will make the playoffs either as an NFC Wild Card team or the NFC West division winner. The Seahawks have a win total of 10.5 o/u thanks to a favorable schedule. They’re a young squad, but established themselves as a playoff-caliber team under veteran quarterback Geno Smith. The Seahawks are +1400 odds to run the table and win the NFC Championship for the first time since they made consecutive trips to the Super Bowl in 2013 and 2014.</p>
<p>The Atlanta Falcons are getting a lot of positive reviews this off-season, but they’re +2200 odds to win the NFC championship. They have the benefit of playing in a wide-open NFC South, and they have one of the top offensive lines in the NFL. All eyes are on rookie running back Bijan Robinson. But the jury is still out on second-year quarterback Desmond Ridder.</p>
<p>The New York Giants stunned a lot of opponents last season and snuck into the playoffs as the third NFC East squad. They even pulled off a road playoff victory under first-year head coach Brian Daboll. Daniel Jones played the best season of his short career under Daboll, and it earned him a hefty pay raise. Running back Saquon Barkley battled injuries in previous seasons, but the Giants can return to the playoffs if Barkley remains healthy in 2023. If Barkley misses time, the Giants could bubble the postseason.</p>
<p>Rebuild Reboot Retool: Bears, Packers, Commanders</p>
<p>The Chicago Bears won only three games last season and secured the #1 pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, which they traded to the Carolina Panthers. Even though the Houston Texans and Cardinals were lumped together with the Bears as the worst three teams in the NFL last season, the Bears are in much better shape heading into the 2023 season. Quarterback Justin Fields leveled up late last season, and the Bears head into this season on a positive note. Fields still needs to improve his passing game. But at least things are looking up in Chicago. The Bears are appropriately priced to win the NFC Championship at +3000 odds.</p>
<p>The Green Bay Packers slammed the door on the Aaron Rodgers era when they traded the disgruntled quarterback to the New York Jets. The Jets are giddy about a potential trip to the Super Bowl, while the Packers look to rebuild the team with an untested Jordan Love at quarterback. He looked good in the preseason, but has a limited sample size, with just one career start. The Packers are a long shot +3500 to win the NFC title without Rodgers.</p>
<p>The Washington Commanders bubbled the playoffs with an 8-8-1 record last season. But head coach Ron Rivera has yet to post a winning season in the nation’s capital. The Commanders hired Eric Bieniemy as their offensive coordinator to revamp the offense, which will be led by second-year quarterback Sam Howell. The Commanders are the fourth-best team in the NFC East, so it’s not a surprise they’re among the long shots to win the NFC at +4000 odds.</p>
<p>Gonna Be a Long Year: Rams, Bucs, Panthers</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Rams went all-in on winning the Super Bowl in the 2021 season, and they’re now paying the price. They won just five games last season because of injuries to receiver Cooper Kupp and quarterback Matthew Stafford, and did not put up much of a title defense. Head coach Sean McVay begins a rebuild with a young squad, but the bookies do not have much faith in the Rams. They have a win total of 6.5 o/u, and they’re a longshot to win a conference title at +4500 odds.</p>
<p>Tom Brady finally retired after spending three seasons with the Tampa Bay Bucs. The Bucs were rewarded with one Super Bowl with the so-called GOAT, but now they start the rebuilding process in their first season without Brady. Baker Mayfield was named the starting quarterback, and the former #1 pick in the draft might be at the last stop in his lackluster career if he cannot put up decent numbers this season. The Bucs have a win total of 6.5 o/u, and they’re at the bottom of the futures board at +6500 odds.</p>
<p>The Carolina Panthers have a new head coach and a rookie quarterback. They traded up in the 2023 NFL Draft to get the #1 pick, which they used to select Alabama star quarterback Bryce Young. Head coach Frank Reich knows this is just Year 1 in a reclamation project, and the Panthers have a win total of only 7.5 o/u. They’re the third-lowest team on DraftKings’ futures board at +5000.</p>
<p>Better Luck Next Season: Cardinals Inept or Taking?</p>
<p>The Cardinals were one of the worst teams in the NFL last season with four wins, which resulted in the dismissal of their head coach and general manager. There’s a new regime running the show, but quarterback Kyler Murray begins the season on the PUP list while he recovers from an ACL knee injury.</p>
<p>Veteran backup Colt McCoy was projected to start in Week 1, until the Cardinals shocked everyone by cutting him. They added Joshua Dobbs in a trade with the Cleveland Browns late in preseason, but he’s only started two games since 2017. The Cardinals drafted Clayton Tune in the fifth round, and the rookie could compete for the starting job.</p>
<p>The Ringer ran an article last week titled, “Are the Cardinals Tanking, or Do They Just Not Have a Plan?” which sums up what most experts are thinking. The Cardinals are the longest longshot on the board at +20000 odds to win the NFC.</p>
