    <h1>Rivers Casino Des Plaines Illinois Margaritaville Resort Casino Bossier City Dreams Casino Casinos A</h1>

<p>Greetings all,</p>
<p>As was already mentioned, november19, the casino cannot influence the process that is out of their control and performed by 3rd party payment provider. Moreover, each involved party usually has 2x7 days to comment in the thread, and the casino representative is still willing to cooperate with us and regularly provides us with updates.</p>
<p>Although we accept that the casino cannot do anything to speed the process up, we are not able to keep the complaint open indefinitely. But, we are talking about a good reputable casino and no unresolved complaints.</p>
<p>After an internal discussion with my team, I am extending the timer by a longer period and will wait again for an update from the casino representative. Despite the fact that it has been taking quite a long time, please, let's stay patient and positive and provide the casino and its payment provider with more time to resolve this situation.</p>
<p>Dear Energy Casino Team,</p>
<p>The timer will be extended as was said. Please, provide us with an update once you have sufficient information from the payment provider.</p>
<p>Please note that if you do not provide us with an update by the time limit, an auto-generated response will be added to this thread - the last 7 days to provide an update. If we do not receive any relevant details even within the last 7 days, the complaint will be (at least temporarily) closed as unresolved. However, then it is possible to request a reopening of the complaint anytime in the future.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that the payment provider will be able to resolve the issue shortly.</p>
<p>Thank you for understanding. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
