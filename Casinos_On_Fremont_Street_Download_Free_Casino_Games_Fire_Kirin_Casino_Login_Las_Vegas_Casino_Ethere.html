    <h1>Casinos On Fremont Street Download Free Casino Games Fire Kirin Casino Login Las Vegas Casino Ethere</h1>

<p>Hi, 19bob83/CasinoGuru Team,</p>
<p>I trust that is everyone is well and safe.</p>
<p>As stated, we have 2 issues that need to be addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The issue relating to the breach of the welcome offer terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The automatic allocation of the welcome bonus to countries (only 1 confirmed at this stage) enlisted on the list of countries restricted from receiving the welcome offer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Relating to "The issue relating to the breach of the welcome offer terms."</p>
<p>For purposes of this discussion point, I have taken the below extract from the welcome offer promotional terms and conditions:</p>
<p>"1. The maximum bet allowed while the welcome bonus is in play is €5. Should you bet higher than this while the welcome bonus is in play, the casino reserves the right to confiscate all winnings."</p>
<p>I can confirm that the 3rd welcome bonus was credited to the account at 18/06/2021 00:17:18, as the bonus had been released 20/06/2021 15:10, any activity between the allocation of the welcome bonus and the bonus release is deemed the "in play" period.</p>
<p>I have confirmed that there were 2 breaches within the activity period, i.e.:</p>
<p>18/06/2021 00:17:18 – Welcome Bonus Credited</p>
<p>18/06/2021 23:33:41 - €50 wager</p>
<p>18/06/2021 23:35:17 - €50 wager</p>
<p>20/06/2021 15:10 – Welcome Bonus Released</p>
<p>Based on the above findings, related specifically to the welcome offer, I do believe that the casino was within its right to confiscate, in accordance with the agreed terms.</p>
<p>Relating to "The automatic allocation of the welcome bonus to countries (only 1 confirmed at this stage) enlisted on the list of countries restricted from receiving the welcome offer."</p>
<p>I have addressed this concern with the relevant divisions within the business, to have this issue correctly as a priority.</p>
<p>Had the breach not happened, I would have a case to have the win amount reinstated, this based on the argument that the system had automatically credited the welcome offer when within its logic, it should have applied an exclusion. The breach however does deem this solution impossible.</p>
<p>Proposed Resolution:</p>
<p>I would like to extend a cash credit to the casino account, to the equivalent of the lifetime deposit amount i.e., €300. This is a gesture of goodwill for all inconvenience caused in this matter.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
