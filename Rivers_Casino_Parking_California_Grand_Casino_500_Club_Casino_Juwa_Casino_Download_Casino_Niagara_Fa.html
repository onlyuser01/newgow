<p>As I already mentioned before, according to the casino's Terms and Conditions, the requests for self-exclusion should be sent to security@betitall.com. At the same time, you should clearly state that you wish to be self-excluded due to gambling addiction. Have you received any answer from the customer support email yet? If not, I recommend you contact the casino via the alternative email address I provided you.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a complex issue that affects many people, and it takes a lot of courage to confront it. I understand that addiction can often lead to feelings of frustration, guilt, and even aggression, and it's important to acknowledge and address those emotions.</p>
<p>While I empathize with the difficulties you're facing, I must also emphasize the importance of taking responsibility for your actions and seeking help. Recognizing this is a crucial step toward finding a way forward.</p>
<p>I strongly urge you to consider seeking professional help for your gambling addiction. There are numerous resources available, such as support groups, counseling services, and treatment programs, that can provide the guidance and assistance you need to overcome this challenge. Reaching out for help demonstrates the strength and willingness to improve your circumstances.</p>
<p>Additionally, I encourage you to explore healthier alternatives and activities that can help redirect your focus and provide fulfillment. Engaging in hobbies, spending quality time with loved ones, or pursuing new interests can help fill the void left by gambling. Remember, you have the power to redefine your identity beyond your addiction.</p>
<p>Please remember that change is possible, and recovery is within your reach. It may not be an easy journey, but it's one worth embarking on for the sake of your own well-being and the relationships that matter to you.</p>
