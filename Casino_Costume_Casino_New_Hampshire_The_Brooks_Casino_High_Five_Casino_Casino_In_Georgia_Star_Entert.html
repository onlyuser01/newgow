<p>The Star announced an update on its property reopenings which includes relaxing of COVID-19 measures. The announcement also shed a light on The Star Sydney performance during the last month. The operator said that its Queensland properties will reopen on July 3.</p>
<p>The Star Sydney Can Welcome up to 5,000 Guests at Any Time as of Today</p>
<p>Star Entertainment Group has released an update on its property reopenings. The update outlines lifting of some restrictions which were introduced previously due to COVID-19. The Star said that restrictions at The Star Sydney are lifted as of today – July 1. At the same time, the operator has announced reopening of its facilities at The Star Gold Coast and Treasury Brisbane as of July 3. The Star did not miss to mention that the next stage of reopening at The Star Sydney as well as the Reopening of The Star Queensland’s properties is in line with safe post-COVID-19 plans. The plans follow the requirements which are outlined by the government public health experts.</p>
<p>Further to the announcement, The Star pointed out that the next stage of reopening for The Star Sydney starts from today. The next stage will feature increasing the maximum number of guests up to 5,000. This will be applicable at any time within the casino areas while supplying a minimum of 4 square meters per person. This requirement is in line with the New South Wales Government (NSWG) regulations. Social distancing is also going to be featured at The Star Sydney. Signs and spacers will be implemented in order to ensure 1.5 meters of distance between guests who are not from the same household. As of today, The Star Sydney will be open to the general public, loyalty club members, and their guests.</p>
<p>Looking back at the beginning of June, The Star Sydney reopened doors only for loyalty club members and guests invited by them. At a later point, this number was increased to 900 guests who could enter by invitation only. Now, under the recent reopening update, this number jumps to 5,000 guests at any time at the Star’s Sydney premises.</p>
<p>The Star Sydney Property Showed Good Results for June 2020</p>
<p>According to the Star’s announcement, the trading performance of The Star Sydney has gradually increased. With the increase of capacity, the venue has also seen an increase in visitation. According to the Star, the average daily slot and table gaming revenues since June 19 have been comparable to private gaming room levels in H1 FY2020. June’s results also showed that a significant increase in visitation was observed when comparing results to H1 FY2020 levels. Furthermore, the Star outlined that the performance of The Star Sydney for last month was in line with the expectations set by management.</p>
<p>Matt Bekier, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer commented by saying: “The health and well-being of our customers and staff remain paramount as we move to this next stage of reopening our properties.” He further outlined that the company’s conservative approach towards reopening gave the company confidence towards safe operations. Bekier further noted that with the current stage, some 3,000 employees of the Star will return to their workplaces. He did not miss to say that this will also result in more members returning for safe entertainment.</p>
<p>The Star’s Queensland Properties to Reopen on July 3</p>
<p>The Star noted that the gaming floors and private gaming rooms at The Star Gold Coast and Treasury Brisbane will reopen later this week. The operator has set the date of July 3 midday to reopen the doors of those venues. The Star Gold Coast will be able to welcome a maximum of 2,600 guests. On the other hand, Treasury Brisbane will see a maximum of 2,300 guests. It’s important to mention that those numbers are actually determined by Queensland’s government requirement which sets a minimum of 4 square meters per person.</p>
<p>The game positioning as well as space distancing protocols which are a part of each property’s plan for safe operations are currently being reviewed by the chief health officer of Queensland. According to the Stars, the operator expects the Queensland’s properties to open for the general public, loyalty club members and their guests.</p>
