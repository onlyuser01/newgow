<p>Digitain a provider of sportsbook software and iGaming platform has joined forces with Pin Up, a popular online casino platform founded in 2016. The deal will see Digitain power Pin Up’s Kazakhstan offer with its sportsbook platform.</p>
<p>Digitain and Pin Up to Offer Sports Betting in Kazakhstan</p>
<p>The agreement will expand both parties’ presence in the Ural region. It will also popularize Digitain’s acclaimed solutions among West Asian gamblers and sports betting enthusiasts. Furthermore, the current agreement will focus on promoting Digitain’s offerings to players in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), an organization encompassing several former Soviet Union countries.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this is not the first time Digitain has worked with Pin Up. Two years ago, the supplier signed a Russia-centered deal with Pin Up’s local platform, pin-up.ru. Since then, the companies have been working together in the country, spreading the word of Digitain’s solutions.</p>
<p>Simon Westbury, Digitain’s chief business officer, shared his thoughts about the new deal. He noted that it is an “extremely exciting opportunity” for his company as it continues to target new regulated markets. Westbury is delighted by the opportunity to expand the supplier’s global geographical footprint and turn Digitain into a leading B2B company.</p>
<p>Speaking about the current deal, Westbury said that he is happy to be able to work with Pin Up, a company that he truly respects. He also noted that Digitain’s entire team is looking forward to developing a very long and beneficial relationship with the operator.</p>
<p>Pin-Up is a great partner and their customers in Kazakhstan will be delighted to experience our award-winning, regulated, sportsbook. Simon Westbury, chief business officer, Digitain</p>
<p>Digitain’s Expansion Is Driven by a Strong Team</p>
<p>Digitain has demonstrated that it is bullish on expanding its reach and further promoting its offerings. To that end, the company recently hired Luís Figo as a brand ambassador. This is no small feat, considering that Figo is celebrated as one of the best Portuguese players in professional soccer. During his career, Figo played for top teams such as Barcelona, Inter Milan and Real Madrid.</p>
<p>A month earlier, Digitain also reinforced its core team by naming Peter Nolan as its new R&amp;D director. Nolan brought two decades of experience to the company and is currently a key player in Digitain’s expansion.</p>
<p>In March, Digitain added yet another veteran to its lineup of professionals. Jason Marcelino, a seasoned veteran in retail gambling, joined the renowned supplier as managing director of the company’s live casino team.</p>
