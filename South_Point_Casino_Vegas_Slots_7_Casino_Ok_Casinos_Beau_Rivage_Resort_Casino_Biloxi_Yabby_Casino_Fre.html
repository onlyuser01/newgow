    <h1>South Point Casino Vegas Slots 7 Casino Ok Casinos Beau Rivage Resort Casino Biloxi Yabby Casino Fre</h1>

<p>About two weeks ago, I registered with Betsomnia and deposited 500€ with a 500€ bonus. I carefully read the bonus terms and it clearly stated that the maximum payout from the bonus on the first deposit is 20,000€.</p>
<p>I was extremely lucky and won slightly more than 20k. After the bonus was fully converted, my balance was reduced to 5000€. I enquired about this through live chat and was directed to the VIP Manager. When I kept asking questions, the VIP Manager told me that the balance is reduced to a quarter once the bonus is used up.</p>
<p>Of course, that made absolutely no sense. I reminded him that the terms and conditions and bonus conditions clearly state 20k and nothing else. Then, I asked him where it says that the amount is chopped into quarters at the end. He couldn't show me and asked where I saw that the max payout is 20k. I showed him screenshots and was only informed that 5k is the maximum amount I could receive. I told him once again that the conditions clearly state 20k, to which the manager simply said it would be updated soon.</p>
<p>I kept arguing for over a week and they are refusing to pay me my winnings of 20k. I have screenshots and videos of the complete terms and conditions and bonus terms at the time of my win.</p>
<p>Betsomnia has since changed its bonus terms and it now states 10x bonus maximum payout. But it didn't say that before!</p>
<p>I am asking for your help, Casino.Guru</p>
