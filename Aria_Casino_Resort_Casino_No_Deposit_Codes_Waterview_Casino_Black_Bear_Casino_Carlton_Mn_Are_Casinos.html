<p>According to the claims, Resorts World and its former COO and president overlooked the presence of felons engaging in illegal gambling activities at the well-known Strip casino</p>
<p>Resorts World Las Vegas, along with its former president and chief operating officer, Scott Sibella, are fighting back against a federal lawsuit filed by Robert “RJ” Cipriani. The legal team for Sibella and Resorts World has submitted a motion to a US District Court judge, urging the dismissal of the six-count lawsuit.</p>
<p>Resorts World Faces Lawsuit Over Alleged Oversight of Illegal Gambling</p>
<p>Cipriani alleges that Sibella and Resorts World turned a blind eye to felons illegally gambling at the renowned Strip casino. In response, Sibella’s attorney, J. Colby Williams, argues that Cipriani has an exaggerated sense of importance on the global stage, reported The Las Vegas Review-Journal. Cipriani, who goes by the aliases ‘Robin Hood 702’ or ‘Robinhoodvegas,’ claims to be an avid gambler, activist, and philanthropist, self-anointed to cleanse the gaming floors of high-stakes gamblers he deems a threat.</p>
<p>Sibella departed Resorts World in September, cited for violating company policies and the terms of his employment agreement, according to the company. The motion to dismiss asserts that Cipriani’s claims lack substance and are driven by personal vendettas rather than factual evidence.</p>
<p>Resorts World Las Vegas is one of the most popular properties on the iconic Las Vegas Strip. Just last week the resort witnessed a surprising appearance of British royals Prince Harry and Meghan Markle during Katy Perry‘s concluding performance of the Play concert residency at the Resorts World Theatre.</p>
<p>Cipriani Accuses Resorts World of Negligence and Conspiracy</p>
<p>Cipriani, seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, accuses Resorts World and Sibella of negligence, civil conspiracy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. He claims to have been a patron of the 3,500-room Strip resort since its grand opening in June 2021.</p>
<p>Tamara Peterson, attorney for Resorts World, contends that Cipriani exhibits a pattern of inappropriate and unlawful behavior in casinos across the United States, often resulting in his barring from numerous properties. Peterson dismisses Cipriani’s allegations as frivolous and predatory litigation.</p>
<p>In response, Cipriani’s California-based attorney, Marshall Cole, deems the motions to dismiss mere distractions. Cole argues that Resorts World and Sibella are attempting to divert attention from the core issues of the case by launching character attacks on Cipriani. He emphasizes that such attacks have no bearing on the merits of Cipriani’s claims and only underscore the defendants’ refusal to take responsibility for their actions.</p>
<p>Cole anticipates responding to the dismissal motions, and the court is expected to rule on these motions within a month. Notably, in February, the Nevada Gaming Control Board concluded a year-long investigation into allegations against Sibella, determining them to be unfounded.</p>
