<p>“I’m thrilled to join the Maxima Compliance team, and I’m particularly excited to help build our presence in the Netherlands from this new office. This is a challenging but high-reward market, where those who draw upon local expertise are already outpacing the competition.” Mike de Graaff, Regional Compliance Manager, Netherlands, Maxima Compliance</p>
