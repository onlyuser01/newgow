<p>Colorado welcomes Australian sportsbook PlayUp through a Bull Durham partnership. The sportsbook is launching both a mobile and online betting platform.</p>
<p>Sports Betting in Colorado Grows with PlayUp Addition</p>
<p>PlayUp has rolled out in Colorado, with the Australian bookmaker breaking fresh ground in the United States. Through a partnership with Bull Durham Casino in Blackhawk and the full regulatory approval of the state, PlayUp’s app and online betting platform are now accessible to anyone who wishes to bet on the outcome of sports in the Centennial State. Yet, the company’s footprint is growing well across the US with its recent assimilation of The Roar and AthletesVoice.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news, Bull Durham general manager Doug James said that he was excited to see PlayUp choosing to team up with the casino. James argued that Colorado is only getting started insofar as the sports betting industry went, citing data from the Colorado Division of Gaming, the state’s regulator.</p>
<p>Last year, sports fans in the state contributed a total of $1.2 billion in wagers, but in January 2021 alone, punters plonked down $326 million ahead of the Super Bowl. Overwhelmingly, wagers in January were placed online, with a total of 98% made remotely.</p>
<p>PlayUp is also ready to take on the competition. The company’s CEO, Dr. Laila Mintas, argued PlayUp is well-prepared to meet demand and extend various incentives to betting crowds in Colorado. Bonuses and promotions are all part of the menu, and they are going to be coming in droves for sports fans.</p>
<p>Yet, PlayUp is equally looking to appeal to sports fans who appreciate both competitive betting as well as those who bet in a more recreational capacity.</p>
<p>Expansion Further on the Cards for PlayUp</p>
<p>“We are trying to focus on the events each month which have the largest audiences and reward the casual bettor with more value,” she added. The company is launching with a 200% match bonus on their first bet as well as a $20 free bet, sticking to a well-established deposit bonus formula over risk-free bets.</p>
<p>PlayUp is present elsewhere in the United States, with Remington Park in Oklahoma and Turf Paradise in Arizona. With over 20 states now legalizing sports betting or en route to, PlayUp has a lot of ground to cover. The company also holds a license in New Jersey and is already offering content through its partnership with Freehold Raceway, a Parx Casino-affiliated company.</p>
<p>Previously, PlayUp signed a partnership with Chalkline to provide free-to-play content for the NHL’s New Jersey Devils.</p>
