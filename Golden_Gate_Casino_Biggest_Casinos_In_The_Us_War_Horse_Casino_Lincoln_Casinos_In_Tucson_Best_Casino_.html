    <h1>Golden Gate Casino Biggest Casinos In The Us War Horse Casino Lincoln Casinos In Tucson Best Casino</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm a problem gambler who has been battling with their addiction for a long time.</p>
<p>I previously sent out an email to various casinos including Highroller, asking kindly to block my access to their site because of my gambling problem.</p>
<p>I asked to close my account permanently if I have one and stop all marketing and provided them with my personal details (blurred in the screenshot).</p>
<p>I fell victim to my addiction and googled 'quick deposit casinos' and then tried to make a quick deposit to their website, which unfortunately went through. As a result of this, I gambled degenerately depositing 2850€ within a few hours and placing bets for nearly nearly 30000€. I also made a withdrawal of 1000€ which went through, and another 1000€ withdraw which I reversed while going on a gambling rampage. These have been sent to the casino also.</p>
<p>I was also in contact with the live chat a few times regarding withdrawals and possible bonuses, no one ever asked if I wanted to re-open my account, neither did I contact them or request this in anyway, more so providing me with bonuses and giving a request to send me an email regarding my account when asking for a bonus. This is the exact reason why I self-excluded, so I would not be able to deposit and lose all my money, clearly stating that I am a problem gambler.</p>
<p>Since I had requested to be permanently banned, which they had confirmed and I never requested to re-open my account, I am expecting them to resolve this issue by returning the funds which I lost (1850€).</p>
<p>I hope they take this case with the seriousness they describe on their website when it comes responsible gambling and the sickness of gambling addiction, as well as take better precautions for this not to happen to other people.</p>
