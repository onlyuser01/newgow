<p>MegaPari, an iGaming brand focusing on the CIS region and operating casino and sportsbook platforms, has been quickly building up its customer base. The operator currently sports more than 150,000 unique users, but the company expects this number to increase 180,000 active users in the first quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>While building up momentum in regulated markets has taken significant effort and expenditure, according to MegaPari Chief Product Manager Daria Karikova, the journey has been well worth it. Presently, MegaPari is represented in CIS countries such as Uzbekistan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Moldova. The company is expecting to continue growing in new geographies as well, with the MENA region listed as one of its key priorities moving forward.</p>
<p>In fact, the company is confident that MegaPari will soon drive strong forays into Arab countries. Both the casino and sportsbook offers by the casino are solid, MegaPari explains, as the operator offers more than 200 sporting events to pick from and brings 20 different game genres across a catalog of more than 10,000 games.</p>
<p>The operator is further equipped to cater to modern consumers and preferences and offers iOS and Android apps dedicated for play on the go along with a robust desktop version. The company is confident that this approach appeals to tech-savvy and young demographic. Outlining the future, Karikova speaks about the companyâ€™s involvement with building the best possible experience for its players and building strong affiliate bonds:</p>
<p>"Also, we are exploring viable partnership and affiliate options to boost our brand's reach and patronage. So, for us, what is more, prioritized is giving our customers real-time entertainment and astonishing value for money and time."</p>
<p>The operator prides itself on being able to deliver round-the-clock customer support solutions that help users with any query that they may have. MegaPari may be a fairly new, having launched in 2019, but it has already won the Rising Star of the Year distinction at the SBC Awards Latino America 2022.</p>
