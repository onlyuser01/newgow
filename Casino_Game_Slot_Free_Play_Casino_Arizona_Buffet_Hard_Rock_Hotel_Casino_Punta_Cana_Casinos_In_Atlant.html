<p>KISS Casino in Biloxi Still a Go, Developer Says, Despite Property Listed for Sale</p>

<p>A $200 million casino project tied to American rock legends KISS remains on track. That’s despite development impediments caused by COVID-19 and the land where it is to be built recently being listed for sale.</p>
<p>The Margaritaville Casino (pictured) has sat shuttered since 2014 in Biloxi, Mississippi. Efforts to bring a KISS-inspired casino to the property remain scheduled, so claims the developer behind the project. (Image: WLOX/Casino.org)</p>
<p>In 2020, local developer Tom Moore reached a deal with the “Rock and Roll All Nite” icons to use their likeness and brand for a $200 million casino resort. The development, pitched as Rock &amp; Brews Casino, is to replace the former Margaritaville Casino on the Biloxi Back Bay.</p>
<p>Speculation arose this week that the KISS casino was no more, after the 10.1-acre property was listed for sale for $15.9 million.</p>
<p>The development is still moving forward and the city is working with us. The owner of the property has always had someone that’s had the property listed, so I still feel like we’re in a good place,” Moore told ABC/CBS affiliate WLOX.</p>
<p>The Margaritaville Casino closed in 2014 amid a dispute between the casino operator and then-landlord regarding a planned hotel. The quarrel led to a hotel never being erected. Mississippi’s casino laws require that gaming facilities be accompanied by lodging.</p>
<p>The disagreement was only part of the problem that led to Margaritaville’s demise. The location of the Back Bay casino remains isolated and disconnected from Rt. 90/Beach Boulevard — the main drag where Beau Rivage, Hard Rock, Harrah’s, and Golden Nugget casinos are located in east Biloxi.</p>
<p>Margaritaville subsequently moved to the Biloxi shore and opened a family-friendly non-gaming resort in June of 2016. The resort is the former Casino Magic.</p>
<p>Guarded Agreement</p>
<p>The Margaritaville property was eventually sold in early 2019 to Arizona-based real estate firm RAM Group. Moore says he has an understanding in place with RAM to continue pursuing his $200 million casino undertaking despite no progress being made at the site for more than two years.</p>
<p>Moore has a most understandable excuse for development setbacks in the pandemic. He maintains that his company has a first right of refusal on any sale RAM seeks.</p>
<p>Moore’s 2020 blueprint for Rock &amp; Brews Casino called for a 300-room hotel with balconies overlooking Biloxi Bay. The casino plan included more than 1,000 slot machines, 36 gaming tables, and a sportsbook.</p>
<p>KISS Involvement Unknown</p>
<p>KISS members Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley co-founded the Rock &amp; Brews restaurant chain in 2012. Today, the company has 17 locations, most of which are in California and Florida.</p>
<p>Moore has been quiet on KISS’ actual involvement with his casino project. But the band’s influence would be quite apparent.</p>
<p>Along with the casino and hotel, the original Rock &amp; Brews Casino plan featured a 3,000-seat concert hall. That would almost double the seating capacity of Hard Rock Live!, which is currently Biloxi’s largest casino theater.</p>
<p>KISS recently wrapped up its latest Las Vegas Strip residency at Caesars Entertainment’s Planet Hollywood. The band is now on its “End of the Road World Tour.”</p>
