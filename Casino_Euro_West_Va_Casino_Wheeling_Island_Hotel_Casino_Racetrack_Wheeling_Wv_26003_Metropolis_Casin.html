<p>The fast-growing and globally-recognized provider of solutions, content and software for the online gambling vertical, Pragmatic Play, announced the launch of a thrilling new product, supercharging its engaging portfolio of content. The company confirmed on Wednesday it introduced Jackpot Play, a new product designed especially to boost customer acquisition and engagement by delivering chances for significant high prizes.</p>
<p>Taking the customer experience to a new level, Pragmatic Play's new product can bring benefits to gambling operators by delivering a local progressive jackpot network. Connecting some of the most popular games within the gambling vertical, Jackpot Play can be configured with titles such as Gates of Olympus, Big Bass Bonanza, The Dog House, Sweet Bonanza, Sugar Rush, as well as other engaging games from Pragmatic Play. The leading developer confirmed that pairing with additional titles can also be expected soon.</p>
<p>Irina Cornides, Pragmatic Play's Chief Operating Officer, shared her excitement about the latest product in a statement released earlier this week. "I'm delighted to announce the addition of Jackpot Play to our growing jackpot portfolio, following the launch of the unique community Power Jackpot late last year," she said.</p>
<p>Finally, Cordnides pointed out: "Available across an ever-expanding selection of premium Pragmatic Play Slots, Jackpot Play lets operators create attractive progressive jackpot experiences for players across their own casino brands."</p>
<p>The new jackpot functionality can drop randomly during gameplay of the aforementioned titles. It allows the players to enter a minigame that features a 4x3 grid. Online players must select different gems that reveal a win. Overall, there are four tiers of jackpots within Jackpot Play: Grand, Mega, Major and Minor. According to Pragmatic Play, each of the tears has "its own win probability and jackpot seed." Once a jackpot is secured, the prize is awarded seamlessly via a transfer.</p>
<p>The announcement about the new engaging functionality comes on the heels of the release of a new slot game by Pragmatic Play. Earlier this week, the company confirmed the release of a new fishing-themed adventure slot game called Big Bass Amazon Xtreme. As the name suggests, the new slot is a part of the famous Big Bass franchise but brings an exciting twist with its unique fishing theme.</p>
<p>The new slot game offers engaging and rewarding features such as free spins, as well as modifiers that grant a chance for big prizes. Big Bass Amazon Xtreme features 10 fixed paylines and is played on a 5x3 reel.</p>
