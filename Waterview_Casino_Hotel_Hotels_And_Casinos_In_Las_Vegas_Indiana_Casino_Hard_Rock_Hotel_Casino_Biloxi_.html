    <h1>Waterview Casino Hotel Hotels And Casinos In Las Vegas Indiana Casino Hard Rock Hotel Casino Biloxi</h1>

<p>I have uploaded all the necessary documents. I made a deposit through a litecoin wallet in $ in the amount of $76.</p>
<p>I want to withdraw 169.95$ of winnings to the same litecoin wallet from which I made my deposit. Your site is broken and now nothing is selected except bitcoin! Set me a payout, please, in the amount of $ 169.95 You advised me to clear the cache and cookies, change the device and browser google chrome. I did all this and now I can’t even log into my account! I enter a password and mail, it requires a two-factor aunt, which I tied, I enter the code and nothing happens when I click login, I also tried it through the phone.</p>
<p>It was last Friday - we agreed to conduct additional verification via skype, agreed to a call on Tuesday at 12:00.</p>
<p>I made a deposit using your link 177% on the first deposit, first won up to 800 dollars, then lost and decided to take 169 dollars.</p>
<p>In general, the call took place, crushed questions in 3 people. They told me to call them my mail, spelled it, as it was written down. They asked me to drop the mail in the chat. I went into the phone and tried to remember how to spell it, tried to find it on my computer, because I don’t remember it by heart (I recently created it), they said where you were looking and hung up. I already said that my boyfriend registered me, we played together, he showed me, I don’t understand anything. All that was required to be named - I named, confirmed the identity. Since I don’t understand anything at all, my boyfriend registered me at the casino through you, he also created mail for me.</p>
<p>We streamed their casinos too! we played this wager for 30 fucking hours, which turned out to be a bonus of 130 dollars, approximately x45 (5400) dollars were won back in 3 days together.</p>
<p>Here is their answer:</p>
<p>Dear Julia,</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback.</p>
<p>We want to inform you that as a result of a Skype video call, your account was not verified in our casino.</p>
<p>The reason for this was the following facts:</p>
<p>– communication with a third party during a call, while according to the terms of video verification, the presence of a third party in the room is prohibited.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>incorrect indication of some personal data, namely e-mail, mobile phone number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deliberately disconnecting from a video call on your part after a request to return to the current conversation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, winnings from bonus funds were confiscated in accordance with paragraph 1 of the General bonus terms and conditions prescribed on our website: "Each bonus offer can be provided for one player, family, home address, email address, phone number, payment account number (for example , debit or credit card, NETeller, etc.), IP and a shared computer (such as a public library or workplace)." And also due to the fact that you have not passed verification.</p>
<p>However, we would like to inform you that you can withdraw the amount of the initial deposit, after which your account will be closed.</p>
<p>Best wishes!</p>
<p>They did not ask to return to the current conversation. They stupidly reset and said your account is blocked. My boyfriend had nowhere to go. She asked me to call right now.</p>
<p>I also thanked them from the bottom of my heart for agreeing to return the deposit. Here is my answer:</p>
<p>thank you so much for coming along. Thank you very much. But I still can't withdraw... I click on litecoin, it's not clickable. I cleared cookies and cache, changed the browser, also tried the device through the phone.</p>
<p>Dear Yula12,</p>
<p>Since you have some difficulties with the withdrawal, the refund will be carried out at the crypto address provided by you above.</p>
<p>If you have additional questions, please contact us at support(@)7bitcasino(.)com anytime.</p>
<p>We wish you all the best!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Team 7BitCasino</p>
<p>As a result, almost the second day has passed, and they have not returned the deposit. Please speed it up.</p>
