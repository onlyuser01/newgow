<p>BGaming has signed a partnership arrangement with iBETSOFT Gaming, a white-label supplier with a particular focus on the Asian market. As a result, the two companies will help provide Asia-facing operators with a distinct portfolio of games, powered by BGaming’s award-winning slots and gaming solutions.</p>
<p>BGaming is bringing more than 100 innovative slot games to iBETSOFT Gaming’s content library, which will help with the company’s efforts to build up its brand and image in the region. BGaming has plenty to offer, with many well-known releases already winning players over in numerous markets.</p>
<p>Amongst the games that will be debuted with iBETSOFT Gaming are Joker Queen, Fruit Million, and Wild Cash, which are expected to strike home with Asian operators and their audiences.</p>
<p>Both iBETSOFT and BGaming are established names in the iGaming industry, bringing years of relevant experience and making it possible for players and businesses to access some of the best-in-class products.</p>
<p>BGaming’s CCO Ulf Norder has said that the supplier already uses a distinct variety of Asian themes and motives in its own games, and the new Asian market trajectory would help the company’s global expansion. The opportunity was similarly welcomed by BGaming Head of Sales Olga Levshina:</p>
<p>"We’re delighted to announce a new partnership with iBETSOFT Gaming. We have previously shared ambitions for expansion across Asia and I hope this marks the beginning of growth in the region. We look forward to providing our much-loved slots to iBETSOFT’s registered players."</p>
<p>iBETSOFT was similarly pleased with the collaboration and said that they were very happy to introduce even more games to the company’s comprehensive white-label system. The company said that its own strength in game development and platform integration, combined with BGaming’s game portfolio, would help operators and players access outstanding products.</p>
<p>"Together, we're committed to delivering the high-quality gaming experiences that keep players coming back for more," iBETSOFT explained. BGaming has made several expansion moves over the past weeks, with the company teaming up with Geogrator to bolster its presence in Georgia and the supplier also launching its products with BetMexico.mx to strengthen its presence in Latin America.</p>
