<p>The initiative, featuring MGM Resort’s renowned responsible gaming program, GameSense, will encourage football fans to bet responsibly while enjoying the thrill of the game</p>
<p>MGM Resorts International and BetMGM are set to launch a groundbreaking responsible gaming campaign in partnership with nine National Football League (NFL) stadiums during the upcoming football season, marking a significant step in promoting responsible gambling practices within the league.</p>
<p>Nine NFL Stadiums Collaborate with MGM Resorts and BetMGM</p>
<p>This innovative campaign represents a pioneering move by MGM Resorts and BetMGM as they become some of the first gaming operators to actively promote responsible gambling through marketing within NFL venues.</p>
<p>Some of the nine stadiums set to showcase GameSense’s responsible gaming messaging include Acrisure Stadium, home to the Pittsburgh Steelers and Ford Field, home of the Detroit Lions.</p>
<p>In addition to their stadium promotions, MGM Resorts and BetMGM are committing over $1 million annually to fund various responsible gaming and problem gambling initiatives. This commitment encompasses research, advocacy, prevention, marketing, and organizational support. Such initiatives aim to create a safer and more enjoyable gambling experience for patrons and employees alike.</p>
<p>The GameSense program, originally developed and licensed to MGM Resorts in 2017 by the British Columbia Lottery Corporation, is designed to foster positive, transparent, and proactive conversations with guests and customers about responsible gambling. This initiative has already been integrated into various aspects of MGM Resorts’ operations, including hotel rooms’ television screens and casino floors, featuring slot machines with GameSense messaging and QR codes to access responsible gaming information.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts and BetMGM Executives Highlight the Importance of Responsible Gaming Initiatives</p>
<p>Rhea Loney, chief compliance officer at BetMGM, expressed the significance of this endeavor, stating:</p>
<p>This is an extraordinary moment as we work with our team partners to raise awareness about responsible gaming. Throughout the season, GameSense will play a pivotal role in reminding football fans who bet to do so responsibly. Rhea Loney, chief compliance officer, BetMGM</p>
<p>Stephen Martino, senior vice president and chief compliance officer at MGM Resorts, emphasized the importance of collaboration in the evolving gaming industry. Martino said that the gaming industry has undergone significant changes in recent years due to the widespread legalization of online gambling and sports betting.</p>
<p>Martino also noted that these endeavors played a vital role in providing guests, customers, employees, and companies with the necessary tools and information for a safe and enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>This announcement coincides with MGM Resorts and BetMGM‘s collaboration with the American Gaming Association to promote Responsible Gaming Education Month (RGEM) in September.</p>
<p>Throughout RGEM 2023, the focus will be on empowering guests and customers to engage in responsible gaming within legal and regulated markets. The partnership also involves heightened employee training, community engagement, and advancing responsible gaming through research. Both MGM Resorts and BetMGM collaborated with AGA for RGEM 2022.</p>
