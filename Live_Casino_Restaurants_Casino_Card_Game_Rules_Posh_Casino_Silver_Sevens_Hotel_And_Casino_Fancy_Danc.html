    <h1>Live Casino Restaurants Casino Card Game Rules Posh Casino Silver Sevens Hotel And Casino Fancy Danc</h1>

<p>CBet.gg is not allowing me to withdraw my funds, despite the fact that I frequently use the site and have been satisfied with it until now. The issue I'm facing is as follows: two days ago, I made a deposit of approximately 300 usdt (240,00ARS$). I started by playing some slots for quite some time, and when I noticed that I was losing, I decided to move to Lightning Roulette. I had some luck with a few bets and managed to get up to 600,000ARS$. I was happy with that amount and decided to stop playing. However, when I attempted to withdraw my money, I was told I needed to place bets aggregating 1,490,000 ARS$ before I could do so. This requirement is completely illogical, as I don't have that kind of money available. I was informed by the support team that this is due to a casino rule called "TurnOver", which is intended to prevent money laundering or suspicious wagering. I find this extremely excessive, as I have provided all my personal information to the casino, and besides, I'm not involved in any suspicious betting â€“ I simply had some lucky bets.</p>
<p>I have also been told the same thing by the Risk and Fraud Security department - that I need to place more bets. A few minutes ago, I was losing all my money, so I returned to roulette and managed to get back to the previously mentioned amount. When I checked how much more I needed to bet in order to withdraw, I found that the amount had inexplicably increased to nearly 2,000,000ARS$. This is incredibly frustrating as I've never experienced anything like this before. I've played on other sites like MyStake, Stake, 1XBet, etc., and I've never been forced to bet all, or several times more than my capital. I have included screenshots of what I was told. The security manager informed me that if I place low-risk bets, the amount I need to bet to withdraw will increase further. Today, I was ready to lose all my money and close my account. I placed a roulette bet of 134,000ARS$, which at that time represented approximately 40% of my balance, and I believe this is far from a "low-risk" wager, yet they once again increased the bet amount for my withdrawal. I feel scammed and extremely frustrated. I hope you can assist me with this issue. I have chat records with the support team available on request. Regards</p>
