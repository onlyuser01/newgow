<p>Rush Street Gaming and Konami Gaming have teamed up once again to elevate the experience at the former company’s Rivers Casino Portsmouth property. Moving forward, Konami Gaming will deploy its SYNKROS casino management system for the operator in Virginia.</p>
<p>The property is going to be the first permanent casino in the state when it finally opens on January 15, 2023, the company informed in a press release. This is also the fifth operator property that will have the SYNKROS technology introduced. Rivers Casino Portsmouth also offers a rich selection of options.</p>
<p>Those include 1,448 gaming machines, 57 table games, a dedicated poker room, and naturally, a sportsbook. There will be other amenities that bettors and guests would be able to visit, such as entertainment and retail spaces, restaurants, food, and beverage options.</p>
<p>Rivers Casino Portsmouth General Manager Roy Corby was particularly excited at this new opportunity. He foremost hailed the merit of the upcoming project which is built as a one-of-a-kind entertaining location that will inspire loyalty and engage with customers, and not least – thanks to SYNKROS. He added:</p>
<p>"It equips the property to achieve its immediate and long-term technology goals while ensuring constant operational management across the casino."</p>
<p>Rush Street Gaming CEO Tim Drehkoff has welcomed the opportunity to add the powerful platform that will no doubt help the company establish itself as a market leader. The Konami SYNKROS system is definitely one of the most powerful solutions that Rush Street Gaming can access, the official assured.</p>
<p>Thanks to this addition, Rivers Casino Portsmouth is going to have a great experience to offer to its guests in the coming year. As to Konami Gaming, the company’s EVP and COO Tom Jingoli similarly confirmed that this partnership was an important step forward. He offered his praise to Rush Street, which he described as a company that was firmly committed to delivering on new technology and making big changes in the industry happen.</p>
<p>This commitment to new tech is what has been helping drive Rush Street’s expansions in major metropolitan markets, Jingoli added. He noted that his company was honored to deploy the SYNKROS tools and tech to aid Rush Street with yet another ambitious project of scale.</p>
<p>Rush Street has shown great dedication to its customer base, as exemplified by the addition of the SYNKROS platform. The company has also turned to Neccton to seek and further protect vulnerable consumers.</p>
