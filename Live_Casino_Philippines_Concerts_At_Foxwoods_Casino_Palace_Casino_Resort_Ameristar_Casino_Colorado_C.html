<p>ReelPlay is very excited to see its games arrive in another regulated market, CEO David Johnson said when addressing the deal</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder, a leading provider of gambling products and services, has announced a new distribution agreement with ReelPlay, a producer of digital gaming content. As per the arrangement, the latter company will, for the first time, supply the British Columbia Lottery Corporation (BCLC) with games.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder revealed that ReelPlay’s international hit Hypernova Megaways will be the first game to make it into the Lottery Corporation’s content portfolio. Under the terms of the agreement, more games will be added in the future.</p>
<p>HYPERNOVA MEGAWAYS continues to engage iGaming enthusiasts, years after its release. The title was debuted in 2018 and followed by other famous games such as Big Buck Bandit Megaways and Atlantis Megaways.</p>
<p>In addition, ReelPlay’s Infinity Reels series is now available with multiple operators around the world. Some of the company’s latest releases include Festival 10K WAYS and Big Bucks Buffalo GigaBlox.</p>
<p>The integration of ReelPlay’s titles into the BCLC shows Light &amp; Wonder’s commitment to supporting independent studios.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder Trusts ReelPlay and Its Games</p>
<p>Representatives from the two companies commented on the newly-minted agreement. ReelPlay’s chief executive officer, David Johnson, noted that Hypernova Megaways is one of his company’s best slots and a top performer in North America. Johnson said that he is happy to expand his company’s reach and provide its games to yet another partner.</p>
<p>Proudly first to market with innovative and inspirational concepts, ReelPlay is very excited to see the game arrive in another regulated market via our partners at Light &amp; Wonder and expect the tri-party relationship to really flourish after this debut release. David Johnson, CEO, ReelPlay</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Steve Mayes, Light &amp; Wonder’s digital partnerships director, noted that his team has been working with ReelPlay for many years. As a result, Light &amp; Wonder trusts in the quality of the studio’s titles and “fully expects” the extended distribution into the BCLC to be a success for all parties.</p>
<p>Light &amp; Wonder’s OpenGaming platform currently delivers more than 3,500 games from a global network of proprietary and partnering studios. The solution offers easy and seamless integrations that are reliable and efficient. Furthermore, all games available through OpenGaming are armed with an extensive range of safer gambling tools.</p>
<p>In other news, a few weeks ago, Light &amp; Wonder teased the possibility of following up on its NASDAQ listing with a secondary listing in Australia.</p>
