<p>GAN to integrate GAN Sports and Super RGS in every future state in which WynnBet becomes operational</p>
<p>Provider of gambling software and technology GAN announced today it has signed an exclusive national partnership with WynnBet for the integration of GAN Sports and Super RGS.</p>
<p>Future State Integrations</p>
<p>WynnBet, via WSI US, LLC, the official entity under which the gambling brand operates, conducted an extensive and highly competitive analysis of all available options on the market before choosing to integrate GAN Sports and Super RGS into its online sportsbook.</p>
<p>Thrilled to announce the third partner for GAN Sports, Rob Lekites, vice president of North American Sports at GAN, outlined the partnership as an excellent opportunity for the company to demonstrate its “innovative sports wagering technology with a market-leading, national brand, beginning with the WynnBet Sportsbook at Encore Boston Harbor.”</p>
<p>The B2B technology provider of real-money gambling solutions and WynnBet agreed that the integrations would happen across all future US jurisdictions for the gaming brand, including the upcoming launch of its retail WynnBet Sportsbook at Wynn Resorts’ Encore Boston Harbor in Massachusetts early next year.</p>
<p>“The combination of GAN’s cutting-edge sportsbook technology with WynnBET’s highly experienced and successful leadership team provides tremendous growth opportunities for both of our organizations,” Lekites continued, hailing the announcement as further strengthening the partnership with WynnBet in Michigan and validating GAN’s “capabilities to provide a highly differentiated and flexible sportsbook” solutions.</p>
<p>Super RGS to Deepen Collaboration</p>
<p>GAN’s Super RGS content aggregation delivery system that will be deployed in all future iGaming jurisdictions in which WynnBet becomes operational online is set to deepen the collaboration with the gambling operator, serving as additional support for WynnBet’s operations.</p>
<p>Lekites was also convinced that the exclusive partnership with WynnBet will bolster the company’s position as one of the nation’s top tech suppliers in the iGaming space, boosting the reception of GAN Sports and enticing new partners willing to benefit from the solution.</p>
<p>On behalf of WynnBet, president of Wynn Interactive Ian Williams said that he and the whole team at Wynn Interactive are looking forward to growing the partnership with GAN and offering WynnBet players “an enhanced sports betting experience.”</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, the gambling technology provider announced an expansion of its contract with global hosting supplier Internet Vikings to cover a total of 15 US-regulated gaming jurisdictions and continue building on a partnership that began in April this year.</p>
<p>In November, GAN reported a relatively flat third-quarter revenue and announced a suspension of its full-year revenue guidance due to market uncertainty across markets in Europe and the US.</p>
