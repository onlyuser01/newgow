    <h1>Restaurants In The Crown Casino Melbourne Thunderbolt Casino Lopesan Costa Bavaro Resort Spa Casino</h1>

<p>A massive casino resort project in Las Vegas that has been waiting to come true for nearly two decades is at the final stretch. Fontainebleau Las Vegas, the latest addition to the iconic Sin City anticipates welcoming its first visitors this December. The resort anticipates opening on December 13, 2023, and has been actively following its plan to meet this deadline.</p>
<p>Now, Fontainebleau Las Vegas made major progress after a meeting Wednesday with the gambling regulator in Nevada, the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB), as announced by the Las Vegas Review-Journal. During the latest meeting, members of the Board questioned Jeffrey Soffer and Brett Mufson, two executives recommended to operate the luxury resort.</p>
<p>Overall, the debate went on for nearly an hour resulting in the unanimous recommendation for approval of the two executives by the NGCB. This step marked a milestone moment for the project, considering that there is one legal challenge left. After Wednesday’s vote of the Board, the executives would seek approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission on November 16, 2023. This would mark the final step prior to the planned opening of the casino resort in December.</p>
<p>Kirk Hendrick, NGCB’s chairman, said that the Board is excited to see a project that has taken some 20 years to finally come true. Moreover, he said that Fontainebleau Las Vegas would bring shine and glamour to a part of the strip that hasn’t been busy for a long time.</p>
<p>“We are certainly happy to see that this 20-plus-year project is coming to fruition as I’m sure you are as well. I’m also happy to see this is fixing and rejuvenating that portion of the Las Vegas Strip that has been dormant for so long, so thank you for that.“ Kirk Hendrick, chairman of the NGCB</p>
<p>Project at Final Stretch after Two Decades</p>
<p>It has taken the project some two decades to come this far. Initially, Fontainebleau was the idea of Soffer as the project started back in 2007. Several years later, due to the Great Recession, the project halted, falling into bankruptcy. After that, Fontainebleau’s ownership changed a few times before Soffer took it back in February 2021.</p>
<p>Fontainebleau Las Vegas represents a multi-billion-dollar investment and promises to bring supreme entertainment. The casino resort would offer more than 3,600 rooms and a massive 173,000 square-foot casino floor. This places Fontainebleau among the venues with some of the biggest gaming floors in Sin City. The massive resort is expected to employ just over 7,000 workers, offering some 5,000 full-time positions. During the latest meeting, Mufson explained that 1,850 employees have already been hired.</p>
