    <h1>Lucky Tiger Casino Casino Shreveport Horseshoe Aliante Casino Hollywood Casino York Bonus Casino No</h1>

<p>PrizePicks has returned to Michigan, this time launching a free-to-play version of its pick’em daily fantasy sports game. The company’s pay-to-play product was recently outlawed in the state but PrizePicks seems to be adapting quickly.</p>
<p>The free-to-play spin of the company’s product will first hit Michigan’s gaming market, allowing fans to once again play with PrizePicks. Similar to the pay-to-play daily fantasy sports game, the new product will feature parlaying between two and six players over/unders.</p>
<p>“Play for Free. Win for Real. Every Day.”</p>
<p>Users will be provided with 1,000 PrizePoints daily they can allocate to their athletes. The top 100 players who finish with 1,001 credits or more will receive prizes of between $2 and $250. This means that PrizePicks will provide participants with daily fun for free while still allowing the top players to win prizes.</p>
<p>PrizePicks’ vice president of innovation, Brian Huss, commented on the new release, saying that it will help the company familiarize more players with the company’s products.</p>
<p>This new free-to-play format is the first of new game types to come and opens the door for us to reach sports fans who may not already be familiar with PrizePicks. Brian Huss, VP of innovation, PrizePicks</p>
<p>Michigan Outlawed Fantasy Sports</p>
<p>PrizePicks is the largest skill-based daily fantasy sports company in the NA region. It offers a simple yet fun take on daily fantasy sports, engaging fans with thrilling experiences.</p>
<p>The company boasts a variety of accolades and was named Fantasy Sports Business of the Year by the Fantasy Sports &amp; Gaming Association, as well as the Fantasy/DFS Operator of the Year by EGR North America.</p>
<p>The launch of PrizePicks’ latest game comes in the wake of Michigan’s decision to ban fantasy contests. According to the state, such products mimic betting and should be prohibited.</p>
<p>The Michigan Gaming Control Board is yet to comment on PrizePicks’ new product.</p>
<p>In September, the Florida Gaming Control Commission also cracked down on fantasy sports operators, issuing cease-and-desist letters to several companies. PrizePicks was among the operators to receive such a letter. Other companies that were asked to stop their betting operations included Underdog Sports and Betr.</p>
<p>However, some critiqued the regulator for not sending similar letters to industry giants DraftKings and FanDuel.</p>
