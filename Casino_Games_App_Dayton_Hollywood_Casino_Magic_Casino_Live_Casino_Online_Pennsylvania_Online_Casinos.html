    <h1>Casino Games App Dayton Hollywood Casino Magic Casino Live Casino Online Pennsylvania Online Casinos</h1>

<p>Hi I am a loyal player at cafecasino.lv and I have a complaint about this site. I have been treated unfairly due to a game on the website called Jackpot Pinatas. I won a bonus on this game with a 5 dollar bet and the game froze and I have not been able to play this bonus. I have brought this problem to the attention of the casino and they will not help me fix this issue so I can play this bonus. So when you get the bonus you are able to choose pinatas and it grants you a multiplier for your wins and at the end of the bonus you are granted free spins. When I go to the game it takes me to a screen stating that my bonus needs to be played. When I click ok it takes me to the bonus screen to proceed to choose my pinata. When I click on a pinata it then gives me an error message saying that the game needs to be reloaded. When I click ok it takes me back to the homepage of the casino. I have troubleshooted this issue in every way possible with all of their recommendations including clearing history, using incognito browser, trying several different browsers, etc etc etc. I have asked live support to help me resolve this and they say they have no evidence I ever played the game which is untrue. I have contacted tech support and they said the same thing. I have contacted moderators on the forum and was asked to provide proof of my issue. I provided them with a video of me sharing my screen which included a screen video of me signing into my account on cafecasino to prove it is my account and then me proceeding to choose the game , and then showing them the error messages and the game kicking me out. I have given them permission to sign onto my account to check it out for themselves and to see that it doesn't work. They refuse to help me with this issue . This means I lose out on my bonus I am owed at $5 bet . They said too much time has lapsed and that they cannot go back in time and check for the gameplay up to a certain date. I brought this to their attention about a year ago and still try all the time to get them to help me and I rejected. I have literally spent thousands and thousands of countless dollars here for the 5 years I have been a customer . I am very disappointed that they will not fix my problem and that they will not compensate me for such a loss. Espexially with the bet being at $5 there is guaranteed winnings that I am being denied . I would like to please ask for help in resolving this issue since they reject me everytime. I believe in confidence that they should honor this issue for me considering the amount of money and time I have put into this casino. I can attach proof such as my screen video showing the issue, screenshots , whatever you need but please help me as I would love to be able to play my bonus I earned and would love to be able to play this game again.</p>
<p>Right here below is a link to the YouTube video I uploaded as proof to cafe casino of the game not working properly .</p>

<p>I really hope you can help me resolve this issue because as stated I am a very loyal customer to cafe casino and have been for 5+ years . I just want to be treated fairly as a customer and I deserve to play my bonus that I paid for it is only fair. If you need any other information from me I am more than willing to provide with any screenshots or information needed to help me get this resolved. Thank you and I appreciate it.</p>
