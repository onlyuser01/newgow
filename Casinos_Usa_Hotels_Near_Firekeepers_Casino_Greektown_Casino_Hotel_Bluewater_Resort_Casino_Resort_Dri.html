    <h1>Casinos Usa Hotels Near Firekeepers Casino Greektown Casino Hotel Bluewater Resort Casino Resort Dri</h1>

<p>The player from Spain is facing issues with a casino that allowed him to play while registered with Rgiaj. Since the casino does not have the opportunity to check such information anywhere and did not know about the complainant's self-exclusion/gambling addiction until the player informed them about it by email, basically, he took advantage to register and play in the casino despite his self-exclusion. The player even did not read the terms and conditions and information about gaming license(s) during registration completely or tried to use the situation in order to ask the casino for a refund later. However, his funds were lost by playing. We concluded the casino should refund the player's funds lost during the period between informing the casino about gambling addiction/self-exclusion in his country of residence and account closure. However, there was no activity on the account at the given time. Therefore, we closed the complaint as unjustified and provided the casino with a recommendation regarding the acceptance of such players and/or possible additional processes implementation.</p>
