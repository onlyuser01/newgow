<p>The partnership with Urgent Games is the latest deal in a long string of content-oriented agreements for Pariplay</p>
<p>Pariplay has penned a new content agreement with Urgent Games, a provider of innovative iGaming titles. As a result, the latter company’s content will become the latest to be integrated into the Pariplay Fusion aggregation platform.</p>
<p>Under the agreement with Urgent Games, the Fusion platform will be enriched with more than a hundred HTML5 games. Some of the new additions include Urgent Games hits such as Wild Cupid, Goddess of Harvest and Gang of Pirates.</p>
<p>Urgent Games is known for its innovative games for mobile and PC devices. In addition to a myriad of slots and fresh crash games, the company also offers a rich selection of traditional casino games, such as baccarat, bingo, craps and roulette, among others.</p>
<p>By joining Pariplay Fusion, Urgent Games will become the latest company to add its content to the aggregation platform. It will, therefore, join an expansive family of iGaming suppliers, including top industry names.</p>
<p>Pariplay is working with some of the most popular games in iGaming and is constantly expanding the richness of its Fusion platform by onboarding new titles from industry-leading suppliers. Some of its latest content deals include agreements with ELYSIUM Studios and Mancala Gaming.</p>
<p>Urgent Games Is Proud to Join the Fusion Platform</p>
<p>Adam Petroli, Urgent Games’ chief executive officer, said that his team is very proud of its portfolio and is excited to integrate its diverse and engaging games into the Fusion platform. He said that this agreement will significantly expand his company’s reach in many key markets, allowing its content to reach many new operators and players.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Enrico Bradamante, Pariplay’s chief commercial officer, said that his team is always looking for new games to add to the Fusion offering. He added that Urgent games are a “perfect match” for his team’s ambitions.</p>
<p>Our aggregation platform has enjoyed incredible success since its launch, and by adding progressive, successful providers, we’re able to sustain it as a market-leading solution. Enrico Bradamante, CCO, Pariplay</p>
<p>Pariplay’s Fusion platform currently encompasses a whopping 14,000+ games from over 80 suppliers. In addition to the vast variety of content, the company also offers a comprehensive range of back-office conversion and retention tools.</p>
<p>The supplier leverages the Fusion platform to supply many top-tier operators with iGaming content. Some of Pariplay’s latest agreements with operators include deals with companies such as Betsson and DraftKings.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Pariplay forged a new partnership with Caesars Ontario, agreeing to supply Caesars Entertainment’s Canadian arm with content from the Wizard Games studio.</p>
