<p>The new Online Gaming and Sports Betting Responsible Advertising Code seeks to protect the consumers and supports the legal offering of gambling services</p>
<p>The leading nonprofit trade association representing online gaming and sports betting companies within the growing regulated gambling market in the United States, iDEA Growth (iDevelopment and Economic Association), has announced the adoption of a new responsible advertising code for sports betting and online gambling.</p>
<p>The Association acknowledged the impact and importance of gambling advertising within regulated jurisdictions. It said that advertising legal sports betting and online gambling options helps boost healthy competition and promotes different choices for customers. At the same time, iDEA noted that responsible advertising practices help promote responsible gambling initiatives.</p>
<p>As a result, the Association reaffirmed that its members commit to its Responsible Advertising Code which includes multiple principles. Such are the implementation and monitoring of compliance with the code and the promotion of responsible gambling.</p>
<p>Additionally, iDEA members need to limit college and university advertising and ensure compliance with the regulations related to iGaming and sports betting in different states where they operate. The final principle involves proper advertising for audiences that are mature enough for either sports betting or online gambling. Usually, the legal age is 21 years and older, unless a state has a specific regulation allowing 18-year-olds to gamble.</p>
<p>iDEA outlined that its Responsible Advertising Code was developed by its Responsible Advertising Committee. The Association noted that the Code will be reviewed on an annual basis and updated if necessary.</p>
<p>The Code Helps Minimize the Risk for Vulnerable Groups</p>
<p>Howard Glaser iDEA’s executive Board Member and Light &amp; Wonder’s global head of government affairs and legislative counsel, explained that the online gambling and betting sector is regulated by a strict set of rules. He outlined that responsible gambling advertising is an inseparable part of the regulations. Finally, Glaser noted: “iDEA and its members are demonstrating that they are wholly committed to responsible advertising because we embrace both ethical practices and our customers’ well-being.”</p>
<p>“Responsible advertising minimizes risks to online sports betting and iGaming consumers by ensuring that advertisements do not target or appeal to vulnerable groups, including minors and people who struggle with addiction.“ Jim Ryan, CEO of Boyd Interactive and executive Board Member with iDEA</p>
<p>Jim Ryan, Boyd Interactive’s CEO and executive Board Member with iDEA, explained that responsible gambling advertising safeguards vulnerable groups such as minors or people suffering from gambling addiction. He said that the adoption of the Responsible Gambling Code by iDEA members reaffirms their commitment to best practices and the promotion of safe and responsible gaming activities.</p>
