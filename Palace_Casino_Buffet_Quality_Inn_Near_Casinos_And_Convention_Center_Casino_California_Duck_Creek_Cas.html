    <h1>Palace Casino Buffet Quality Inn Near Casinos And Convention Center Casino California Duck Creek Cas</h1>

<p>CrazePlay Casino - GAMMIX, been holding me up for almost 4 weeks since my first withdrawal.</p>
<p>I done all of the KYC checks and SOW. I have send them my requested bank statements, my id, my ID60, my company files. Everything I have, I have send them. I keep getting the same response and I reply with all they asked for. I have a balance of over 200.000 euros and a withdrawal standing for 5,000 because that is their weekly limit.</p>
<p>I'm unable to reach out to any of them and live chat keeps saying I need to send a email.</p>
<p>I have send everything to them, that they asked for. This is giving me so much stress and I have been crying almost every single day.</p>
<p>They keep saying:</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Crazeplay Casino.</p>
<p>Kindly note that the relevant department is still working on your case, please be patient until they complete the revision of your documents and contact you via e-mail. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>If you need any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us, our service is available 24/7.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
