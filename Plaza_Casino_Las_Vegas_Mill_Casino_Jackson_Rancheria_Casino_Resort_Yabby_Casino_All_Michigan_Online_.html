<p>Lille and PSG are the only two clubs that have won the French Ligue 1 title in the past five seasons. PSG is the team that won four titles, while Lille did it once. Knowing that PSG is the most expensive team in France, it’s no surprise the Parisians have been so dominant in the French league.</p>
<p>They’re expected to win the title once again, with the odds of PSG winning the 2022-23 Ligue 1 being just -2000. Judging by what we’ve seen so far from PSG, it seems the bookies are right to think so. They are 2-0-0 since the start of the season, which puts them right at the top of the Ligue 1 table. Can that change on Sunday?</p>
<p>That’s when Lille and PSG meet at Stade Pierre-Mauroy in Villeneuve d’Ascq. Lille’s home ground is their fortress where their fans cheered them on to success many times in recent history. The bad news, however, is that Lille’s fortress just hasn’t been effective against PSG. For instance, in their most recent duel played on Lille’s turf, the visitors won 5-1.</p>

<p>When, Where, and How to Watch?</p>
<p>Date : Sunday, August 21</p>

<p>Lille Look Ready for Battle</p>
<p>Lille’s manager in the 2022-23 season is Paulo Fonseca, a Portuguese coach who previously led teams like AS Roma and Shakhtar Donetsk. He was one of the top candidates for the managerial post at Tottenham Hotspur a few years ago, but the Spurs bosses decided not to hire him due to his overly attacking-minded style of soccer.</p>
<p>Tottenham wanted a more defense-oriented coach, but Lille’s directors were more than okay with Fonseca’s tactics. They appointed him the Lille head coach in late June, and since then, he’s led this team in two Ligue 1 matches.</p>
<p>Paulo Fonseca’s LOSC is a team to pay attention to this season.</p>
<p>Another top talent from France decided to stay despite interest from PL. Huge achievement for French football. https://t.co/AY0ItdZrNH — Minas Vergis (@MinasVergis) August 17, 2022</p>
<p>His managerial debut with Lille saw his team destroy Auxerre 4-1 at home. In his second match as the Lille boss, his team drew 1-1 with Nantes on the road. The reason why they didn’t win isn’t that they were bad. On the contrary, Lille’s players were the ones who were attacking throughout the game, keeping the ball in their possession for 70% of the game and making 50% more goal chances than the opposition.</p>
<p>The reason why they didn’t win is that Nantes defended with all they got. This weekend, however, you can be sure that Lille’s opponent isn’t going to defend. PSG players are going to attack and we’re sure Lille will want to fight back.</p>
<p>PSG Look Unbeatable</p>
<p>PSG is the best team in France, there’s no doubt about that. It’s as if there’s no way any other team can win the French Ligue 1 this season. Of course, winning the domestic title isn’t their only goal. These guys would love to do the same on the continent.</p>
<p>That said, you can be sure that PSG are going to take the Champions League super-seriously this season. But, until that competition starts, their no.1 focus is Ligue 1. This is the championship in which they have two wins after two rounds with a score differential of 10-2.</p>
<p>PSG’s top scorer in the 2022-23 season is Neymar with three goals. Lionel Messi is just behind with two goals to his name, while there are another four players who have put away a goal each (one of PSG’s goals this season is an own goal by the opposition).</p>
<p>Lille vs PSG Prediction</p>
<p>Our top prediction for the Lille vs PSG game is that there’s going to be plenty of goals. We should see goals on both ends, but it’s PSG that should put away more goals in total.</p>
<p>Picks: PSG to win; Over 4.5 goals</p>
