<p>Sports betting media group Better Collective announced today it has entered into a partnership with The Chicago Tribune to complement the offering of the leading source of news and information in the Midwest with betting content.</p>
<p>Deliver Engaging Sports Betting Content</p>
<p>The new agreement between Better Collective and Chicago Tribune will see the sports betting media business deliver betting odds, tips and analyses of teams and players for the upcoming games, as well as links to sports betting platform partners, to the readership of over 18 million monthly visitors of chicagotribune.com.</p>
<p>“Our readers depend on The Trib for sports news and information and the recent expansion of legalized sports gambling in our readership area makes this partnership with Better Collective a timely way to serve our readers,” said Mitch Pugh, executive director of The Chicago Tribune.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Better Collective’s chief executive officer and vice president Marc Pedersen focused on the sporting side of the Midwest and Chicago and the “many great sports fans of different types of sports” in the area.</p>
<p>“We are very happy that we can bring engaging content, data and tips to dedicated readers of the Chicago Tribune that want to learn more about sports and sports betting,” Pedersen added.</p>
<p>Co-Branded by Action Network</p>
<p>Expected to become operational by mid-August for the start of the NFL season, the partnership will be co-branded by Action Network, the supplier of premium content, proprietary tools and in-depth analytics, and Chad Millman, chief content officer at Action Network also commented on the news.</p>
<p>“As a Chicagoland native, I know local sports fans have a hunger for expert sports betting information,” Millman stated, “thrilled to partner with the region’s most respected news authority” by “delivering together depth and breadth of content” and support The Chicago Tribune’s readership with insightful sports journalism.</p>
<p>The partnership with The Chicago Tribune is the latest agreement Better Collective reached with a prominent news media coming just over a month after the sports betting media teamed with The Philadelphia Inquirer.</p>
<p>Under the media partnership with the publication, Better Collective agreed to deliver innovative technology and engaging sports betting and iGaming content to its readership of nearly 10 million per month.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, Better Collective posted impressive first quarter performance with record high revenues, driven mainly by its operations across markets in the US where revenues accounted for almost half of the company’s total.</p>
