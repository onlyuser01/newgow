    <h1>Fast Payout Online Casino Gold Fish Casino Real Money Casinos Hollywood Casino Hotel Maryland Height</h1>

<p>Hello Petronella,</p>
<p>I am sorry for the writing errors in my original submission... looks like some words were deleted (woops).</p>
<p>I have been playing there for a short while (less than a year) and I always use Jeton. I have mentioned this to the agents there before and they simply hushed me by saying I needed to deposit 10 euro... at that time, I just shook my head and proceeded to play...</p>
<p>After awhile of no bonuses working, I contacted the chat and asked them to go over my deposits, to see how much money I have missed out on seeing that I always use Jeton to deposit (it was a significant amount actually)... so my case was then transferred to a manager, who gave me a freeplay and some free spins - all good! However, the next time I played there, I did go to the chat to ask them to help me with the 20% bonus, as obviously the manager who credited me with spins etc.. had seen my account and agreed, right? Or they wouldn't have given me the freebies. (Which, I kind of paid for but anyway..)</p>
<p>So this last time, I did just that - went to the chat. Well oh my god. Liliyana began by flat out refusing to which I asked her why doesn't this promo work, if it doens't work shouldn't it be fixed? from that point forward, I was told that I am taking advantage of a system bug, that I already GOT free spins and basically to screw myselft. THIS was not the case at all; ANY player who is in this region would have the same deposit bonus, with just a click. In no way shape or form was I: taking advantage of a bonus (that particular bonus is there all day every tday, its not "special" persay...</p>
<p>So, what gives the casino the right to discriminate against me for the Jeton bonus, refusing me then telling me that I am taking advantage of the bonus system (I wasn't, I had deposited, and just wanted what was advertised, and I met the criteria), I am a loyal customer, I've continued to play here, why can't I ask them to manually add it? It seem that's not an outrageous request, and facts are it's THEIR promo!</p>
<p>I understand this all seems very trivial, but I have never been treated so poorly at any casino, the agent trying to make ME out to be the bad guy here - it's nuts.</p>
<p>So what is the answer? Just shut up and let this go? Seems super unfair. And when I deposit, I am entrusting that establishment to play by the rules, and when they don't, well, that's a problem. That's my money I am putting into that casino, whether it be $100 or $1 it's the principal of the whole thing.</p>
<p>I was told that my case was being forwarded to a manager. That they would be in touch with me via email I guess; I haven't heard a thing yet... I did play my amount deposited, as I certainly don't deposit to sit and wait for a week... Like I said in the beginning, they owe me (according to the promo, which I followed to a t) $1. What I'd LIKE to see is them either fix the promo or remove it or reword it to say something else, it's false advertising!</p>
