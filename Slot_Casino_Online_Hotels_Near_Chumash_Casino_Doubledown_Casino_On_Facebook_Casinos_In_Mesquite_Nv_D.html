<p>The Buckeyes Dreaming of Their 1st Win in “The Game” in This Decade</p>
<p>The Buckeyes lost the last two games against their arch-rivals. They’ve been without a win over the Wolverines since 2019, but maybe this Saturday is the day when the wait ends?</p>
<p>A thing that’s giving their fans some hope that they can pull it off is that Ohio State’s defense has been phenomenal in 2023. These guys are No. 1 in the nation when it comes to pass defense. That said, the Buckeyes should be able to put on a good defensive performance at Ann Arbor, but what about their offense?</p>

<p>Their starting quarterback Kyle McCord has seriously upped his game over the last couple of weeks. He’s got 22 touchdown passes to his name in the 2023 NCAAF season, with 10 of those happening in his last three games. Further, he’s without a single interception in the last two games.</p>
<p>McCord’s favorite target in 2023 has been Marvin Harrison Jr., who’s scored a total of 13 passing TDs this season, five of which happened in the three games Ohio State has played this month.</p>
<p>When it comes to Ohio State’s running game, TreVeyon Henderson has been in the spotlight. The running back has made 118 carries this season for 794 yards and 10 touchdowns. A great thing about Ohio State’s running game in 2023 is that it’s not just about one player. In addition to Henderson, five other Buckeyes have scored a rushing TD this season.</p>
<p>Problems Keep Pilling on for Michigan</p>
<p>Michigan’s head coach Jim Harbaugh is suspended by the Big Ten Conference and won’t be there to lead the Wolverines in “The Game” on Saturday. He won’t be there on the field, but he’ll probably get the players ready for the crucial game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Michigan, the absence of their coach isn’t the only problem they’re facing. Their starting quarterback is also struggling with fitness. J.J. McCarthy missed the previous game due to injury, so there are worries that he might not be back to his top level by Saturday.</p>
<p>Further, his colleague from Michigan’s offensive team, wide receiver Roman Wilson, picked up an injury last week, for which he’ll miss the 2023 Buckeyes vs. Wolverines game.</p>
<p>There might be some problems with their defense as well. Even though they conceded the least number of points of all Big Ten teams, they did get outplayed a couple of times last weekend by the Maryland offense.</p>
<p>Taulia Tagovailoa and the Terrapins scored 24 points against the Wolverines – the highest number of points this team’s conceded in 2023.</p>
<p>Ohio State Buckeyes vs. Michigan Wolverines Prediction</p>
<p>The NCAAF odds are in favor of the Wolverines, but we think the Buckeyes are going to cause an upset. Everything seems to be lining up in their favor right now, making the 2023 Ohio State vs. Michigan game an opportunity they mustn’t miss.</p>
<p>Pick: Ohio State Buckeyes</p>
