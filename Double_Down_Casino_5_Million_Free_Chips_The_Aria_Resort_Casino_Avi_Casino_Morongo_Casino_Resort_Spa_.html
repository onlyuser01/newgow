    <h1>Double Down Casino 5 Million Free Chips The Aria Resort Casino Avi Casino Morongo Casino Resort Spa</h1>

<p>iSoftBet has teamed up with Slotegrator for additional content distribution capabilities brought on by the aggregator’s network of partners and reach. iSoftBet will integrate 150 of its distinguished products with Slotegrator’s API, the APIgrator, which will then be available to players.</p>
<p>Expanding the Reach and Originality of Both Companies</p>
<p>Part of the games that will be added to Slotegrator’s platform includes Tyrant King Megaways, Golden Gallina, and Moriarty Megaways. The Megaways mechanics has gained a lot of attention from players who have been seeking original games that feature thousands of paylines.</p>
<p>Slotegrator will also offer partners a distinct range of iSoftBet’s player engagement solutions that are designed to further enhance the rapport with players. ISoftBet will benefit from Slotegrator’s well-established footprint in regulated gaming markets around the world, boosting its product offering expansion as well as appealing to new audiences.</p>
<p>In turn, Slotegrator is benefiting from more unique content it would use to leverage its brand and sign new customers as well as reinforce standing with existing customers. Commenting on the deal, iSoftBet head of business development Lars Kollind said:</p>
<p>“Bringing our unmatched gaming experiences to players all around the world is a clear focus for us and by partnering with Slotegrator we’re able to widen our reach further than ever before.” iSoftBet head of business development Lars Kollind</p>
<p>Thanks to the partnership with Slotegrator, iSoftBet will be breaking ground in key regulated markets, Kollind argues.</p>
<p>Hold &amp; Win, Megaways and More</p>
<p>Slotegrator leading sales manager Ayvar Gabidullin is equally pleased with the development, congratulating iSoftBet on the company’s extensive collection of Hold &amp; Win and Megaways titles.</p>
<p>The games offer immersive environments that are proving a big hit with players. Powerful imagery and engaging gameplay are touted as other strong features of iSoftBet’s product offering.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to be able to add this to our comprehensive offering and look forward to reaching new heights together,” Gabidullin added.</p>
<p>Slotegrator completed a product integration with NetGaming in October. iSoftBet has similarly had a strong 2021 so far. The company managed to break ground into Greece and increase its footprint in Latin America. As an aggregator, iSoftBet negotiated a partnership with Coolbet in October.</p>
