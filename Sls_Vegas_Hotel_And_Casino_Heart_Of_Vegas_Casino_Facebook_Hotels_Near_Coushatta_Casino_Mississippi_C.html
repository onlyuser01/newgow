    <h1>Sls Vegas Hotel And Casino Heart Of Vegas Casino Facebook Hotels Near Coushatta Casino Mississippi C</h1>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out.</p>
<p>We highly value your feedback and we will do our best to improve our service further.</p>
<p>We would like to note that the clientâ€™s account was indeed found duplicate to another account at our brand. Both of the accounts used welcome bonus offer at the same time, which is not allowed at our project. We would like to draw your attention to the following points of Terms and Conditions:</p>
<p>3.2 Your account with the Website must be registered in your own, correct, name. Only one account per person, per household/address, per phone number/email, and per IP address is allowed. Any other accounts that are opened on the Website will be considered as "Duplicate Accounts". You must not attempt to open a Duplicate Account, including by providing false or alternative credentials. If you open or attempt to open any number of Duplicate Accounts, we reserve the right to close some or all of your accounts without any compensation and apply the following sanctions:</p>
<p>each action performed using a Duplicate Account is considered void;</p>
<p>any promotions that the Duplicate Account has participated in will be cancelled;</p>
<p>any winnings obtained on the Duplicate Account will be void. Any processed withdrawals will be reversed and will be owed back to the Company;</p>
<p>the Duplicate Account will be closed without an option to reopen it.</p>
<p>7.18 If you engage in any promotion abuse, fraud, or manipulation this shall be considered as a breach of the Terms. In such cases, and in addition to other remedies available to us, we reserve the right to void all promotions you participated in, void and confiscate all the winnings derived therefrom, and prevent your participation in future promotions</p>
<p>Based on the above, the winnings from the bonus were cancelled and account closed by our Risk Team. Despite the fact that deposit was played down before the bonus was activated, we have made a decision to refund the deposit in full. The payment was processed after the account closure and the client was informed accordingly.</p>
<p>We hope the above clarifies the situation.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact us should there be any further questions.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Nomini</p>
