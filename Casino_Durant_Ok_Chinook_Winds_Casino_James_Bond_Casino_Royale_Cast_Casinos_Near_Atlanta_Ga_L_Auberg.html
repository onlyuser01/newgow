    <h1>Casino Durant Ok Chinook Winds Casino James Bond Casino Royale Cast Casinos Near Atlanta Ga L Auberg</h1>

<p>Dear Peter,</p>
<p>Thank you for your involvement in resolving this matter. After a thorough review, here's a concise summary:</p>
<p>The player registered with BlueChip Casino as a Swiss citizen on June 30th, but was later identified as a Portuguese citizen, a restricted jurisdiction. In accordance with our procedures, we initiated an account verification check and requested verification documents.</p>
<p>On June 30th, 2023 the player has activated verification page and uploaded one document (Portuguese passport). Our General Terms and Conditions (as outlined in p.2.2 and p.2.3) clearly state the following:</p>
<p>"2.2 The Company does not provide any assurances or warranties with regards to the legality of your use of the Website, particularly in case gambling is prohibited, regulated or unregulated in your jurisdiction. It is solely your responsibility to know the laws of your country concerning online gambling and the use of the Website at all times. Before attempting to make use of our Website you must verify whether online gambling is legal in your particular jurisdiction and the legal age to participate in gaming. By using this Website you warrant that you are legally allowed to gamble online. If at any time online gambling in your jurisdiction becomes illegal or otherwise restricted, you must immediately close your account with the Website and stop using its services."</p>
<p>"2.3 Citizens and residents of the following countries (the "Excluded Jurisdictions"):</p>
<p>Afghanistan, American Samoa, Aruba, Australia, Belarus, Dutch West Indies and Curaçao,</p>
<p>Cyprus, Cuba, Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), Ethiopia, France</p>
<p>(including French Guiana, French Polynesia, French Southern Territories), Iran, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Lebanon, Libya, Lithuania, Laos, Malta, Moldova, Myanmar-Burma, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Portugal, Russian Federation, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Syria, Ukraine (including the territory of Crimea), the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Yemen do not have the right to open accounts with our Website or add monetary funds to their accounts....If you live in, are citizen, or are located in one of these jurisdictions, you agree not to open and/or use your account on the Website and to immediately close your account if you have previously opened it. By using our Website, you warrant that you are not a citizen or resident of such jurisdictions."</p>
<p>On July 11th, the player placed total €1,237.07 for withdrawal, triggering a verification request again. At this moment the player still didn’t finish verification procedure.</p>
<p>The player submitted proof of address via email on July 31st, a month after the initial request, raising authenticity concerns. User didn’t upload it via verification page as it was still active for him. Additionally, we must emphasize that the player sent the utility bill to us more than a month after our initial request via email, and it has a June date, which suggests that it may not accurately reflect the player’s current circumstances.</p>
<p>Despite being given the opportunity to provide additional verification documents, the player did not upload any other documents, such as a selfie or a screenshot, which he was fully capable of doing. The player also failed to complete the Know Your Customer (KYC) process within 30 days.</p>
<p>On July 31st, the player's account was blocked by our team and his winnings were blocked due to p. 4.4, 9.6, and 9.7 of our Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>While understanding the player's dissatisfaction, we cannot overturn Blue Chip's decision. We believe the actions align with ethical practices and transparent communication. Please let us know if you need any other clarification or documents from our side.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>BlueChip Customer Care Manager</p>
