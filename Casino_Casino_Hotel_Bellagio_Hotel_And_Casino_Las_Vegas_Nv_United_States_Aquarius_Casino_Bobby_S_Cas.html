<p>Rivalry Esports or Rilvary.gg is one of the first endemic esports betting sites in the world. An early adopter, the website today offers esports betting markets on 20 different games, and counting, and runs a generous $100 welcome bonus. The website has a 24/7 customer support and sponsors some prominent esports entities, to name Fnatic, Beastcoast, Fvria, and B8esports.</p>
<p>Rivalry runs regular markets on Dota 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive along with other established esports competitions. There are 11 dedicated payment options and an academy where you can find out more about esports betting in general. We have covered this and more in our dedicated Rivalry.gg review.</p>
<p>Rivalry Welcome Bonus: Get 100% Matched Bonus up to $100</p>
<p>Rivalry.gg features a TL; DR bonus section which will help you catch yourself on the $100 bonus and the bonus terms and conditions. You receive the bonus as soon as you deposit at least $15 and punch in the WELCOME100 promo code. Your first deposit is matched by 100% up to $100 and you have 30 days to wager it.</p>
<p>To unlock the bonus funds, you will need to first wager your real money balance (2x). Once you do, you will gain access to the bonus funds. For any bet you place with your bonus funds, only the winnings of successful bets will be accredited to your real money balance.</p>
<p>Players must also make bets of odds that are at least 1.5. If you want to withdraw your bonus funds, you must first convert them into real money by betting and winning. Once the funds expire, they will be removed from your account.</p>
<p>Any funds you win and are credited to your real money balance are available for immediate withdrawal without any additional requirements.</p>
<p>Available Esports Markets</p>
<p>Esports variety isn’t an issue with Rivalry and the website features 20 different games you can bet on. Each game will come with many various markets you can bet on, with some contests reaching over 50 available bets.</p>
<p>Players will find themselves choosing from all mainstream competitive games, and specifically first-person shooters (FPS), massive online battle arenas (MOBAs), mobile games, sports simulators, and even massive multiple online games (MMOs). As an esports fan, you will be able to place a bet on all minor and major competitions, including:</p>
<p>Dota 2</p>
<p>CS: GO</p>
<p>Call of Duty</p>
<p>Overwatch</p>
<p>League of Legends</p>
<p>Rainbow 6</p>
<p>Starcraft 2</p>
<p>Hearthstone</p>
<p>There are many other smaller markets that are now available to bet on, such as World of Warcraft, World of Tanks, SMITE, FIFA, Halo, Hearthstone, and more. An interesting fact is that during the 2020 lockdown, FIFA and NBA 2K generated 80% of all esports bets.</p>
<p>However, traditional gamers will always have their sights on the most popular video games, betting on big and regional tournaments, and having access to the full range of available matches and competitions.</p>
<p>Use the Filter for a Quicker Search</p>
<p>You can have a quick look through all available competitions supported by Rivalry Esports by simply clicking on the game you are interested in.</p>
<p>This will reveal the current list of active events you can bet on. Alternatively, you can just go to the main betting panel and check what events are coming up next.</p>
<p>There are additional filters that allow you to sort a game you bet on by Start Time, Event, Biggest Payouts, and Closest Odds.</p>
<p>To complete a bet, all you need to do is to just click on the team you prefer and want to back, enter the amount you want to deposit and agree to the bet. All bets will be settled once the game has been completed.</p>
<p>Rivalry.gg Deposits and Withdrawals</p>
<p>Depositing or withdrawing money on Rivalry Esports is very easy. The website has 11 dedicated payment methods you can use to complete transactions. You can deposit as three separate types of users: Unverified, Unverified, and Enchanted. Here is what each means in terms of available funds to deposit:</p>
<p>Unverified users: $15 – $100</p>
<p>Verified users: $15 – $1,000</p>
<p>Enhanced users: $15 – $10,000</p>
<p>For withdrawals, you must be a verified user or otherwise, you won’t be able to request cashouts. Rivalry allows verified users to withdraw between $15 and $1,000. For enhanced users, this limit is set at $10,000.</p>
<p>Presently, all esports bettors can choose from the following available options to complete a transaction at Rivalry.gg:</p>
<p>AstroPay</p>
<p>Bank Wire</p>
<p>Visa/MasterCard</p>
<p>Pay4Fun</p>
<p>Much Better</p>
<p>Skrill</p>
<p>Neteller</p>
<p>Qiwi</p>
<p>Yandex</p>
<p>Pago Efectivo</p>
<p>Western Union</p>
<p>The majority of these payment methods will allow you to deposit and withdraw instantly, which is a huge plus. Credit card withdrawals will take a while to process, and last, you may want to avoid Bank Wire as it takes the longest to process, usually around seven to 15 business days.</p>
<p>Live Esports Betting at Rivalry.gg</p>
<p>Shortly after launching in 2018, Rivalry added a live (also known as in-play betting) feature, allowing you to bet directly while a game is in progress. This fits perfectly with the nature of esports, which are embraced by fans who love to watch games on Twitch and don’t mind having the opportunity to flick a bet while at it. Live esports markets are available at Rivalry’s discretion and not all games are covered as a live betting market.</p>
<p>Rivalry Academy: Never a Bad Idea to Pick Something New</p>
<p>The Rivalry Academy is another interesting addition to Rivalry’s offer. Started in 2019, the academy’s purpose is simple: to teach esports fans the ropes of betting. The academy has many worthwhile chapters new bettors will find immensely helpful, such as how to choose a good esports betting site, budget your bankroll, and understand esports betting odds and payouts among many other useful chapters.</p>
<p>Safety, Security, and License</p>
<p>Esports sportsbooks are fairly new, but they are already trustworthy. Rivalry.gg is no different. The esports bookmaker is part of the Esports Integrity Coalition (ESIC) network created to safeguard the fairness of esports competitions around the world.</p>
<p>Rivalry holds an official license from the Isle of Man government and the sportsbook complies with responsible gambling policies. Another reason to trust the website is its partnership with FNATIC, Beastcoast, FVRIA, and B8Esports, four established esports entities with a huge following around the world.</p>
<p>Rivalry also supports a Reddit forum you can visit and the website comes with the necessary SSL encryption. Players will be subject to KYC and AML verification checks to ensure that the sportsbook is free of any illegitimate parties, boosting the overall security for everyone.</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>
<p>If you need help with anything about Rivalry.gg and the available esports betting markets, you can always get in touch with the website’s customer support. You will receive assistance 24/7 via live chat or email at [email protected]. You can also call at +44 20 3966 1374.</p>
<p>Verdict</p>
<p>If you are new to esports betting, you will find Rivalry.gg a great place to start. The navigation is smooth, simple and to the point. Players will find all their favorite games listed at the bookmaker, whether this is Overwatch, Call of Duty, Dota 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and many others.</p>
<p>The website is a real globe-trotter, with the user interface, as of the time of our Rivalry.gg review, available in six languages, including English, Korean, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian.</p>
<p>You will find both getting to terms with betting just as easy as cashing out your winnings instantly. Not sure where to start? Why not try with the $100 casino bonus?</p>
