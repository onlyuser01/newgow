    <h1>Casinos In Blackhawk Colorado Choctaw Casino Resort Durant U S 69 Durant Ok Duck Lucky Casino Upper</h1>

<p>I made 4 withdrawals from the platform in BITCOIN, using the BTC network. I noticed that with each transaction exactly 0.0004 BTC were missing. In total, I'm missing 0.0016 BTC, which is approximately 48 USD. I contacted the casino, which firstly took a long time to respond and secondly, and no less importantly, asked me to provide all the information, which they can see in my casino account. After providing all the requested information, I was told that the problem is with the personal wallet to which I sent the money, and it's not their issue. They followed this up with a screenshot of my exchange showing some fees. However, this screenshot was not complete, because I found this information on my own exchange and clearly stated that these fees do not apply to incoming deposits to the exchange.</p>
<p>I investigated each transaction and they all show the same, leaving the casino with less money than requested. I also confirmed that the fees applied to each transaction on the BTC network were significantly less than what is missing.</p>
<p>Here is a Drive link with all the photos, as I'm unable to upload all the files, and below the link I've provided all the transactions from the btc network (which the casino does not provide): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X9z_TXkmGNml6Ov2X9hs_XqH0bcaySpJ?usp=sharing</p>
