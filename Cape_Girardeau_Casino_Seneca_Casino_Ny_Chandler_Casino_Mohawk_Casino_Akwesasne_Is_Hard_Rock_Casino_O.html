He spoke about the unique advantages of the new product explaining that there’s “no product that’s situated like this.”</p>
<p>“I think we fill a huge gap there in the market that people can take advantage of and that really hasn’t existed before. So that’s one of the biggest benefits.“ Richard Jones, CEO and co-founder of Bitline</p>
<p>Additionally, Jones explained that the development and design of Bitline has taken more than a year and a half.
