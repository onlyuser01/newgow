<p>RAW iGaming has announced the acquisition of Sapphire Gaming, a promising developer with an established track record that will now boost the company’s footprint in the iGaming space. Thanks to Sapphire Gaming, RAW iGaming will be able to scale up its own development capacity and focus on strategic goals for 2022 and beyond.</p>
<p>Sapphire Gaming Joins RAW iGaming’s Family of Brands</p>
<p>Sapphire Gaming is already an author of innovative and immersive gaming experiences, namely the SuperSlice series which the studio developed. The company is also in the process of unveiling a new gaming engine that will boost the high added value of the gaming experience.</p>
<p>RAW iGaming CEO Tom Wood welcomed the opportunity to be expanding the company’s production capabilities by securing a partnership with a highly innovative albeit private studio. Wood, though, had no doubt about the reputation and expertise at Sapphire Gaming:</p>
<p>“I am so happy and proud to be able to work with one of the smartest, hidden, minds in the iGaming industry, Alec Horley, including his brilliant Sapphire team, which will continue their work in our new office based in the UK.” RAW iGaming CEO Tom Wood</p>
<p>RAW iGaming is keen to keep the Sapphire team intact and allow Alec Horley, the company’s current CEO, to continue to develop and operate on their own terms while benefiting from RAW’s added expertise where appropriate. The companies will be looking to develop new game mechanics and technologies as well as introduce the new aggregation platform by RAW to new customers.</p>
<p>RAW has worked with the Sapphire Gaming team in the pats and the two companies have a lot in common, Wood assured, arguing that the pair will considerably strengthen their development capacity and boost their shared know-how. Horley welcomed the news on a similar note and said that Sapphire was excited to be joining the RAW iGaming family.</p>
<p>RAW and Sapphire Committed to Building Unique Gaming Propositions</p>
<p>Horley is confident that working with RAW will help push the industry boundaries further and deliver more unique, “never-before-seen” solutions that will become a part of the industry’s landscape.</p>
<p>RAW has been rapidly looking to acquire new partners who share the company’s same grassroots-driven commitment to making unique products. Even the company’s credo, “Stand Out or Stand Down” exemplifies that thirst for a unique approach to building new solutions for the industry. RAW is currently based in several countries, to name Malta, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Argentina.</p>
