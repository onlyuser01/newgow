<p>John Hunter and the Quest for Bermuda Riches review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>This game is themed around the iconic John Hunter, an Indiana Jones type hero. The setting for this particular adventure is a tropical island.</p>
<p>Players will feel the sand on their toes as they follow John Hunter along a beach. With ocean waves crashing nearby, they’ll begin a mysterious quest for treasure.</p>
<p>This slot is a good fit for players looking for an exotic escape into a world of palm trees and precious gems. John Hunter promises to be a daring leader as players join him on his exploits.</p>

<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The soundtrack is an ethereal yet epic tune mixed with the calls of seagulls and waves. This sets up a seaside adventure vibe and players will feel like they are standing on the tropical beach with the titular hero.</p>
<p>The beach setting has an immediately warm feeling with a blue sky and bright sun. Exotic plants fill the foreground, including vines and gently waving palms. A blue butterfly occasionally flutters by, adding to the natural feel. Farther in the distance, players will see the turquoise sea glimmering as well as intimidating cliffs. The quality of the animation of this setting is especially good, giving a sense of grandeur.</p>
<p>John Hunter stands beside the reels and is animated in slightly less impressive quality. He sways back and forth slowly like a video game character, holding his whip in one hand and a gold artifact in another. These objects add to his likeness to Indiana Jones.</p>
<p>The reels are eye-catching with a plethora of colourful gems and artifacts. Players may notice that the jewels are cut in the shapes of card suits, each with its own vivid hue. Golden goblets and spy glasses also appear on the reels, reminding players of the archeological nature of the quest at hand.</p>
<p>Overall, the soundtrack and animation of this game combine to create a tropical adventure mood.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>John Hunter and the Quest for Bermuda Riches is played on a seven by seven grid.</p>
<p>Winning combinations are formed from groups of five or more matching symbols connected horizontally or vertically.</p>
<p>The game has a Cascade feature, which means that when symbols are part of winning combinations, they will vanish to make way for new symbols which fall down from above to replace them.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols except the Scatter, Money and Collect symbols.</p>
<p>For each spin, the Money symbol takes on a randomised value. If at least one Money symbol lands and one or more Collect symbols land at the same time, one of three features is triggered, depending on the type of Collect symbol. There are three Collect symbols with the following effects:</p>
<p>Collect: All Money symbol values are added together and paid out.</p>
<p>Extra Credit Collect: The value on the Extra Credit Collect is added to all Money symbols which are then collected and added to the player’s payout.</p>
<p>Multiplier Collect: All Money symbols on the reels are multiplied by the value of the Multiplier Collect symbol and paid out.</p>
<p>Extra Drop Collect: Additional Money symbols are added to the reels with randomised values.</p>
<p>Win with one of the bonus features of the game</p>
<p>The Wild symbols can land as a Cursed Wild, triggering the Cursed Wilds feature. The Cursed Wilds feature prompts either additional multipliers to be applied to any wins using that Wild or additional Wilds to be added to the reels.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature is triggered when players land at least 3 Scatter symbols. The feature begins with 12 free spins. Both the Money and Collect symbols are active during this feature, with Money symbols added to a bonus pot that can later be won.</p>
<p>Should players land 3 or more Scatters while in the Free Games feature, they receive an additional 5 free spins. This re-triggering is not limited and special reels remain in play throughout the feature.</p>
