    <h1>Ho Chunk Casino Wisconsin Dells Casino San Diego Doubledown Casino Promo Hollywood Casino Wv Ri Casi</h1>

<p>I joined the casino but created 2 accounts as i wasn't convinced the cash back was working correctly on the 1st account. Subsequently I found that it was which was my misunderstanding.</p>
<p>I played various games on the 2 accounts at different times not hoping to gain any advantage but just as a result of having the 2 accounts. I can't login to accounts now as they have been closed but i imagine I had lost more than i had won.</p>
<p>There was never any query when i was depositing funds but last Friday i had played a game on 1 account and won some money and tried to withdraw the money. At this point I was told there was an investigation into my account (accounts).</p>
<p>I think the next day i played on the other account. Again was allowed to deposit no problems but the problem came on withdrawal.</p>
<p>Then I complained to customer support and got the following response:</p>
<p>Dear Paul,</p>
<p>We hope this email finds you well. We are writing to inform you about the outcome of the recent investigation conducted by our team at Shark Casino. We regret to inform you that we have found evidence indicating that you have violated our casino's terms and conditions by maintaining multiple accounts on our platform.</p>
<p>As you are aware, having multiple accounts is strictly against our casino's policies. We take such violations seriously as they can compromise the fairness and integrity of our gaming environment. Our team has identified that you have maintained multiple accounts with different details, which is a clear breach of our terms.</p>
<p>In light of this violation, we have made the difficult decision to close all of your accounts permanently. This means that you will no longer have access to any of your accounts on our platform, and any associated balances or winnings will be forfeited.</p>
<p>We understand that you may have reasons for having multiple accounts; however, we must enforce our policies consistently to ensure fairness for all our players. Maintaining multiple accounts can lead to unfair advantages and adversely impact the experience of other players.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or require further clarification regarding this decision or the closure of your accounts, please do not hesitate to reach out to our customer support team at [contact information]. They will be available to provide assistance and address any concerns you may have.</p>
<p>We appreciate your understanding in this matter, and we kindly request that you refrain from creating any additional accounts on our platform in the future. Our commitment to maintaining a responsible, transparent, and fair gaming environment remains unwavering.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Customer Support</p>

<p>So, in summary the casino has closed my accounts and taken my funds (not just the winnings but also my deposit) and closed the account.</p>
<p>If they had taken the winnings I would have thought that was not right, but to also take my money as well to me is closer to theft.</p>
<p>Again, we have to bear in mind that I was gaining no advantage having 2 accounts. I had not taken any of the welcome bonuses or other bonuses offered. The only thing i got was cash back on my losses.</p>
<p>Reading the terms and conditions on shark's website i can see (i see it doesn't mention taking your original deposit):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If we close a Duplicate Account:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All bonuses, free bets and winnings accrued from such bonuses and free bets obtained using that Duplicate Account will be void and forfeited by You;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, at our entire discretion, void all winnings and refund all deposits (less amounts in respect of void winnings) made in respect of that Duplicate Account and, to the extent not recovered by us from the relevant Duplicate Account, any amounts to be refunded to us by You in respect of a Duplicate Account may be recovered by us directly from any other of Your Accounts (including any other Duplicate Account); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may, at our entire discretion, allow usage of the Duplicate Account to be deemed valid in which case all losses and stakes placed by or for You through the Duplicate Account shall be retained by us.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please can you look into this. I have had many online accounts over the years and even when I have had a duplicated account in the past it was closed and the original account left open (and the funds remained intact). I didn't aim to get any advantage which is seen in the fact i didn't even take any bonuses.</p>
<p>Thank You,</p>
<p>Pau.</p>
