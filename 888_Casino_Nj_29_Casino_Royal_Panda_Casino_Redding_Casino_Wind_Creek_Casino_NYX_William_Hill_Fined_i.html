    <h1>888 Casino Nj 29 Casino Royal Panda Casino Redding Casino Wind Creek Casino NYX William Hill Fined i</h1>

<p>The Division of Gaming Enforcement for New Jersey has slapped two gaming companies with penalties over regulatory failings and self-exclusion shortcomings.</p>
<p>NYX and SG Digital to Pay $100,000 for Multiple Regulatory Failings</p>
<p>The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) has issued two civil penalties against casino gaming supplier NYX and British gaming operator William Hill. The companies were slapped with heavy penalties over failings to meet self-exclusion standards and releasing games that have gone preliminary vetting.</p>
<p>The period of the fines concerns specific failings in the offerings of both companies between November 16 and November 30. Around the same time, PokerStars was fined $5,000 for over-stepping data laws and retaining information the operator should have disposed of.</p>
<p>SG Digital, the company that owns NYX, was handed a $100,000 fine, since the developer subsidiary failed to clear games with the DGE before releasing them. A total of three games were released in violation of 13:69D-2.3(f)2 of the New Jersey Administrative Code.</p>
<p>NYX was also fined for specific regulatory violations, such as having casino employees must ensure that all software works as intended. One specific failing the DGE cited had to do with the software itself whereby the solutions used by NYX failed to detected self-excluded players who have been trying to access gaming products.</p>
<p>William Hill Fined in New Jersey for Self-Exclusion Shortcomings</p>
<p>The DGE has established shortcomings in the offer of British gaming operator William Hill. According to the regulator, the sportsbook has accepted 16 self-excluded players, prompting the DGE to slap a penalty of $26,500.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the regulator has also been trying to improve the overall advertising environment in the Garden State. DGE boss David Rebuck urged media outlets to be very careful with the products they advertised, and specifically any offshore gaming operators.</p>
<p>The DGE has yet to issue a penalty that comes even close to the fines in the United Kingdom. For instance, in February 2018, William Hill was fined the whopping $8.7 million for failings to enforce anti-money laundering measures.</p>
<p>Since then, the company has made sure to update its offer and be particularly careful in enforcing KYC and AML practices. The latest fine isn’t too bad either, as William Hill is caught in a rapid expansion across the United States, owing to the US subsidiary of the company.</p>
<p>In November, William Hill US announced that it’s tipped for a Florida expansion with a racebook at Casino Miami. The sportsbook and gaming company’s expansion has been going strong in the country.</p>
<p>Even after the strict £2 FOBTs measures at home, the operator has been able to recoup most of the financial impact and focus on new opportunities while balancing the market at home.</p>
