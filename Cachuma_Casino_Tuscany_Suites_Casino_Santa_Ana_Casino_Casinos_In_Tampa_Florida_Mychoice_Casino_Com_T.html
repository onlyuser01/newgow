<p>The contest's grand prize will be $100 Weekly Bet Credits with Tipico for one calendar year</p>
<p>Global sportsbook operator Tipico announced today a new initiative related to the March Madness tournament comprising an in-app competition and various other promotions.</p>
<p>March Madness Fans Contest</p>
<p>This year’s March Madness will allow Tipico’s mobile app users to participate in a contest tied to the popular college basketball tournament. The competition will last the length of March Madness and will award the first-place winner, nine runner-ups and states’ leaders with free bets for one year.</p>
<p>“March Madness is a celebration unlike any other, one that combines unparalleled competition, underdog storylines, and drama that reminds us why we love college sports,” commented the chief executive officer of Tipico US, Adrian Vella, proudly unveiling the contest and promotions aimed at further elevating the operator’s sportsbook experience alongside the culmination of the college basketball season.</p>
<p>The competition has simple rules and anyone placing a minimum of $20 wager is eligible to participate. Points will be accrued according to whether the bet wins and the odds of the bet: every winning bet with “+” odds receives the number of points equal to the odds; if the bet has “-” odds but less than -200, the player receives 20 points; if the bet is -200 or loses, it accrues 0 points.</p>
<p>While the odds of creating a “perfect bracket” are next to none, game and prop bet odds on Tipico allow bettors to fully personalize their tournament-watching experience. Adrian Vella, CEO, Tipico US</p>
<p>The contest will also present weekly top-performing players after each tournament round with exclusive awards, as Tipico will maintain a national leaderboard which will be updated after each round with the results from the previous round.</p>
<p>The first-place winner will receive a grand prize of $100 Weekly Bet Credits in the Tipico app for one calendar year, while the nine runner-ups and individual state winners in Ohio, Iowa, New Jersey, and Colorado will be awarded $20 Weekly Bet Credits for one calendar year.</p>
<p>Streaming Show and Ohio On-Site Events</p>
<p>To elevate the fan experience during this year’s March Madness further, Tipico introduces a tournament-related streaming show, The Shot, featuring game previews and analysis presented by Duke University NCAA Champion and NBA All-Star Christian Laettner and host and sports media personality Lauren Jbara.</p>
<p>“Our team has worked tirelessly to create a one-of-a-kind sportsbook experience that mirrors the exhilarating, quick-hitting nature of the NCAA Tournament and adds new layers of entertainment and suspense to this storied event,” said Tipico chief commercial officer David Paschkes, thrilled to present basketball fans with more ways “to be excited about this year’s ‘Big Dance.'”</p>
<p>Alongside the streaming content, fans in Ohio will have exclusive opportunities to engage with the sportsbook operator through on-site events at Rhinegeist Brewery in Cincinnati, Lower.com Field in Columbus, TopGolf Cleveland, and others.</p>
<p>Last month, Tipico became the exclusive sports betting partner of the 2023 Arnold Sports Festival held at the Great Columbus Convention Center in Columbus, Ohio, to affirm its growing footprint in the state.</p>
