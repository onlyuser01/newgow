<p>Austria’s ‘Poker King’ Folds His Hand, Declares Concord Card Casinos Bankruptcy Over €600 Million Tax Bill</p>

<p>Austria’s 12 Concord Card Casinos have been shut down forever, according to their owner, Peter Zanoni, whose CCC Gruppe filed for bankruptcy this week under the weight of a €600 million tax bill.</p>

<p>Zanoni, dubbed by local press as “der Poker-König” (Poker King), has been fighting an oppressive tax regime since the mid-1990s that put him on the hook for up to five times the amount of CCC’s actual gross gaming revenues.</p>
<p>In addition, under a change in Austrian gaming law effective from January 1, 2020, poker clubs like Zanoni’s now require a full gambling license, whereas previously they had been able to operate under a business license.</p>
<p>The catch is that only the state-backed monopoly, Casinos Austria, can apply for a full gambling license.</p>
<p>‘Not Even God Could Pay’</p>
<p>Since the EU has long frowned upon the Casinos Austria monopoly for its violation of the principles of free cross-border trade, Zanoni had vowed to fight this all the way to the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p>But he appears to have folded his hand. He told the Austrian Press Agency (APA) that he could no longer wait for the outcome of a complaint in the country’s Constitutional Court, which was expected to have made a ruling in February.</p>
<p>Of the €600 million ($676 million) tax bill from hell, he said: “Not even dear God can pay that … For every gross euro, I have to pay a five-euro tax… This is simply a chase that is now over.”</p>
<p>CCC’s operations were taxed on stakes, rather than revenues. That means that in a tournament where the player-funded prize pool is, say, €100,000, it was forced to pay a percentage of the whole €100,000 rather than on the small rake it took from the pool as the operator.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, Casinos Austria’s poker games, like all its other games, are taxed by revenue.</p>
<p>Police Raids</p>
<p>Zanoni initially shut down his venues following a raid by financial police on the Montesino venue in Vienna in January, citing “illegal and excessive administrative measures against the [CCC’s] operations.” He also cited a desire to protect guests and employees from exposure to “the unqualified pressure of the financial police.”</p>
<p>He recently reopened some venues to offer free-to-play games, hoping that he could make some revenues from selling food and drink. But on Monday, he sent a message to his several thousand employees, announcing the card rooms would be closing for good.</p>
<p>Zanoni characterized it as a David versus Goliath dispute, but one in which David lost.</p>
<p>Proceedings are still pending in the European Court of Justice and the Austrian Constitutional Court.</p>
