<p>Hi after many attempts to maje 2 withdrawals of funds 2 weejs ago with House of Pokies. I have to continually on more than a daily basis check progress and chat online for help and advice of 2 withdrawals using bank transfers as the limit for withdrawal is 5000 in total 1 withdrawal of 5000 and 2nd withdrawal was 1600 and after many attempts i finally had my id and bank cards verified due to continual follow ups through myself. customer support was varied in help.</p>
<p>after returning my funds without reason into casino credit again and had asked them befor hand was there any other issues as i could upload more if needed , befor returning funds and starting the process again . they has said i now need selfies with they various documents and would be noted that I am uploading requested selfies. As I was uploading they returned funds. I queried why and had screenshots of the online communication and got a receipt number via email and little help saying the photos were not in hi resolution. again I got another person to take photos to make sure they were clear hi res shots waited another 4 days with continual onkine chats to various custoner support uploading as requested through email and there online banking. At this stage i the withdrawl amounts were 1 of 5000 and 2 of 1200. Again after stated they woukd allow time for myself to upload which i did via customer support and email as my profile upkoaded documents had reached capacity. if it wasnt for myself continually following there would be no communication from House of pokies.</p>
<p>This is now my 5th attempt after asking continually for a supervisor or finanacial team member with no luck. it has been 3 days now since the last uploas with my idrntity bank cards etc approved and selfies still pending. Iam concerned as it was winnings from y own funds with no bonuses. Is there any way of assistance Regards Steven Muir</p>
