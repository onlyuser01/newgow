<p>Soccer fans in Africa know their trade according to a pre-tournament survey which showed that the first four of the five teams they ranked as capable of winning the trophy are in the quarterfinals and boasting a chance of becoming the next World Champion.</p>
<p>Nearly Two-Thirds to Wager on World Cup Matches</p>
<p>The survey conducted by GeoPoll just days before the beginning of the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar among 1,853 users of the researchersâ€™ mobile app across Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda ranked their favorites to win the tournament as follows: Brazil, Argentina, France, England, and Germany.</p>
<p>Of those five, only the fifth-ranked Germany could not pass beyond the group stage after losing their opening match against Japan proved costly, while the first four favorites progressed to the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>And Africans are keen bettors, too, with 61% planning to wager on the World Cup matches, and almost two-thirds (64%) of the respondents have placed a bet in the past twelve months, predominantly those from Kenya and Ghana with 68% and 60%, respectively.</p>
<p>African soccer audiences rank the upcoming World Cup as the most popular tournament in the sport, with 93% planning to watch the matches in Qatar. The finding showed an increase from the 85% who watched the previous edition of the tournament, FIFA World Cup 2018 in Russia, which boasted a combined 3.572 billion viewers globally.</p>
<p>TV and Mobile Phones Preferred to Watch the Action</p>
<p>The survey revealed that soccer matches are being watched more than once a week by 59% of the respondents and 55% keep watching the half-time commentary, while 46% switch to their mobile phones, and only 29% move to other activities. Almost a third (28%) said that they would be either placing or checking their bets at half-time.</p>
<p>Among the platforms used to follow the World Cup action, TV remained the most preferred choice with 82%, despite the notable shift towards the mobile space with 54% planning to follow the matches on their phones. A factor that may have influenced their responses is the time zone difference as at the time of the kick-offs most of them would be still at work, school or commuting.</p>
<p>The survey respondents who were predominantly young males due to the methodology used in the research also revealed that soccer enjoys quite an interest in Africa with 35% rating it in the highest possible segment of between 1 and 10, 13% putting it in the second category and 16% placing the sport in the third segment.</p>
