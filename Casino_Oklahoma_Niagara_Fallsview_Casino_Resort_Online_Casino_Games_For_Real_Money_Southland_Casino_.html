    <h1>Casino Oklahoma Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort Online Casino Games For Real Money Southland Casino</h1>

<p>Hi Petronela</p>
<p>Deposit details as follows;</p>
<p>$50 on 10/03/20 at 1509 $50 on 25/03/20 at 1835 $20 on 25/03/20 at 2053 $50 on 28/03/20 at 1945 $30 on 28/03/20 at 1954 $20 on 28/03/20 at 2016 $30 on 31/03/20 at 2130</p>
<p>Withdrawal details as follows;</p>
<p>$545 on 29/03/20 at 1727 - Cancelled due account not verified $545 on 31/03/20 at 1534 - Cancelled due account not verified $545 on 31/03/20 at 1536 - Cancelled due account not verified $545 on 31/03/20 at 1551 - Cancelled due account not verified $500 on 02/04/20 at 1201 - $545 on 31/03/20 at 1534 - Cancelled due to breach in bonus terms</p>
<p>I can't remember which ones came with a bonus because they don't show individually in my account.</p>
<p>Wager Beat claimed the $30 deposit on 28/03/20 in which I claimed a $4.50 bonus is where the breach occurred. With this Wager Beat removed the $500 I tried to withdraw on 02/30/20 from my account and replaced it with my last deposit of $30.</p>
<p>At no stage during all that game time was I notified of any breach and at the time of the alleged breach I already had between $600 and $700 in my account.</p>
<p>When I asked why we aren't notified about any breaches or why the spins were allowed to continue, the response I got from the customer service rep was "because we don't want to disrupt or ruin the gaming experience"??!!</p>
<p>As I said to them I already had over $600 in my account prior to the alleged breach and the alleged breach occurred on a $4.50 bonus. They are using that excuse to rob me of my legitimate winnings!</p>
<p>This is not just unfair but it is unlawful for them to take my winnings.</p>
<p>Please help</p>
