    <h1>How Much Do Dealers At Casinos Make Sky River Casino Restaurants 123 Vegas Casino Login Online Casin</h1>

<p>Goodnight,</p>
<p>When I made the 1st deposit of €100 I was given a bonus of equal value, so far so good, I played for a week, I happened to win and every time I played nothing was taken away from the bonus value but always from the "real" value, and finally the bonus they gave me was taken away from me, but anyway, if they say that the conditions are those, that's fine, it was my fault that I didn't read them trusting the casino and the questions I asked in the chat about it and they hid me about the bonus disappearing at the end of a week.</p>
<p>But then I had to resign myself because it was my fault, I didn't read the "terms and conditions", only that while I was talking in the chat they removed about €30 more from the bonus as it was €130 and they even had the nerve to say that I had spent them in the last game, when by chance the only game and the last one that I played even won as you can confirm in the game history. All this just because after taking the 100€ I decided to withdraw the other 100€ that I had in real value.</p>
<p>I have already asked for it 3 times and every time it is refused, something is wrong, I have already sent all the requested documentation by mail and in the chat and they continue to refuse because something is always wrong.</p>
<p>As ironic as it seems now they say that the copy of the Citizen Card I sent cannot be in pdf and therefore they do not return the money that belongs to me, is it weird because the other documents accepted in pdf and the CC does not accept? it's just excuses of bad pay.</p>
<p>Compliments</p>
<p>Antonio Ramos</p>
