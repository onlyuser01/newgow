    <h1>Casinos Near Me With Slot Machines Aruba Casinos Casino Resorts In Louisiana Wind Creek Casino Onlin</h1>

<p>FYI tell players to send bitcoin to an online casino let’s say coinbase that the fees went up 1000% a few days ago I sent $28 of bitcoin to gossip slots and Coinbase took $22.54 plus my $28 I failed to look at the fee because I’ve done it 1000 times before and it’s always a couple dollars at most now they deducted $50.54 of my bitcoin so I ain’t doing that again Coinbase says it’s not them Gossip says they have nothing to do with it and it’s Coinbase because blockchain fees are higher when the crypto network is busy which is baloney because it’s going on 72 hours straight now that the fees haven’t gone down at all like I said it’s getting worse and United States banks don’t allow you to buy crypto with a bank card or debit card they provide you with and if they find out your sending bitcoin to a casino ? You’ll be asked to leave the bank same with cashapp tell them the bitcoin your buying through them your going to send to an online casino and you will be banned from cashapp for life and I’m sure other bitcoin providers have the same rules in fine fine print that nobody reads and if you are doing it then that provider doesn’t know where it’s going but they are starting to check just another fyi</p>
