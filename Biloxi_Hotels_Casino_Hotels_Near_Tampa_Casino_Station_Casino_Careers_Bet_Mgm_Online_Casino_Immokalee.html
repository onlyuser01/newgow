<p>Why do losers in gambling can not accept the few winners in any sector of gambling.</p>
<p>They can not win. criticize others when winning, try to make them fail but do not succeed themselves.</p>
<p>Systems have been posted that can not be broken into loss but losing gamblers still can never accept they have failed in life and gambling and leave winning to the few winners.</p>
<p>If you can not win then stop. stop losing and do something you can make money and be happy in life. Not a sore loser. Casinos an be broken by the few, not the many erratic gamblers who can not stop when in profit and walk away a winner.</p>
<p>Moderators will always endorse sensible gambling, not gambling till no funds are left to gamble away. So think as a profit taker not as a lottery winner.</p>
