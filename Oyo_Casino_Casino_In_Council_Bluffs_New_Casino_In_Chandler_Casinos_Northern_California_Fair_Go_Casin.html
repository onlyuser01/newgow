<p>PlanetPay365, a multi-service payment platform owned by Austrian-based sports betting company SKS365 signed a partnership deal with AS Roma from the Italian Seria A.</p>
<p>Brand Visibility and Fan Initiatives</p>
<p>The sponsorship agreement between PlanetPay365 and AS Roma covers the 2021-22 season of the top-flight soccer league in Italy and will enable the fans of the club from the Italian capital to benefit from a wide range of products offered by the sponsoring partner.</p>
<p>As an Official Partner, PlanetPay365 will have its logo displayed on the sidelines during home games of AS Roma, while the payment platform provider will undertake various other initiatives to improve its visibility among fans of the Giallorossi.</p>
<p>Besides having its brand featured on the sidelines at Stadio Olimpico during home games of the Serie A regular season and Coppa Italia matches, PlanetPay365 will utilize AS Roma’s online channels for brand visibility via digital campaigns created in collaboration with the team.</p>
<p>The partnership between AS Roma and PlanetPay365, which will offer soccer fans services ranging from phone top-ups to gift cards purchases and digital content, will also involve PlanetPay365’s retail network in Italy. There, the company’s parent holds the second-largest share in the sports betting market.</p>
<p>The sponsorship deal falls in the same category as the deal signed between PlanetPay365 and Torino FC last March in which the SKS-owned brand ensured sideline visibility via the branding on LED advertising hoardings during home games at Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino.</p>
<p>There was a flurry of sponsorship deals signed between Serie A soccer teams and sports betting companies in line with the blanket ban imposed on gambling advertising by the government from January 1, 2019, which covers only the domestic market and opens up international opportunities. Among those which signed internationally-focused partnership deals with sports betting operators in the recent months were Inter Milan, ACF Fiorentina and AC Milan.</p>
<p>AC Milan teamed with Premier Bet in July to make the African-based sports betting operator its official betting partner in Africa and further expand the popularity of the soccer club among the millions of its fans on the continent. Recently, the sports betting brand linked in a similar way with AS Monaco from the French Ligue 1.</p>
<p>Inter Milan initially signed a deal with Asian-based sports betting operator AYX to follow in the footsteps of AS Roma and name the brand its official partner in the region and then followed with a similar arrangement with HappyBet, a brand operating in Germany and Austria.</p>
<p>ACF Fiorentina also followed the same model and signed a sponsorship agreement with OlyBet in October to make the Baltics sports betting brand its official regional betting partner.</p>
