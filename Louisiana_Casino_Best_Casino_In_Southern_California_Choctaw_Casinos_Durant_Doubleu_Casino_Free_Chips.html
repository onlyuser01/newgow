<p>GG.BET, a renowned esports betting company, and BLAST Premier, the host of the namesake and iconic competitive video game tournaments, have teamed up for a new global partnership that will see the operator featured as the official sponsor for the organization, and specifically for its Counter-Strike tournaments that are S-tier events and reunite the game’s elite players over dozens of events every year.</p>
<p>GG.BET and BLAST Premier will introduce a number of activations that will focus on talent predictions and the BLAST.tv Pick ‘Ems, which is a betting-focused production, along with live betting odds integrations that will allow GG.BET to provide its own audiences with the most accurate betting information as it happens.</p>
<p>BLAST will in turn hope to achieve better engagement with the millions of esports fans who love Counter-Strike around the world. The partnership will also embark on other marketing initiatives, such as social media giveaways, exclusive content, digital behind-the-scenes and more.</p>
<p>BLAST SVP of Commercial Alexander Lewin welcomed this opportunity and said that it would indeed help BLAST Premier to better engage with the Counter-Strike community. He further hailed GG.BET’s presence within the esports betting and Counter-Strike ecosystem and noted that the bookmaker has ties with Team Vitality and NA’Vi.</p>
<p>GG.BET was similarly pleased with the chance to deploy its offering with BLAST Premier, hailing the organization and the competitive series as the pinnacle of Counter-Strike contests.</p>
<p>"Not only do our plans for this year align, but both our brands share common values and a desire to push esports to a whole new level. Pooling our resources with such a strong partner will allow us to make this year yet another unforgettable one for the esports community," a spokesperson for GG.BET said in a press release.</p>
<p>Esports betting has been sending serious waves around the world, and BLAST is currently broadcast in 154 territories and 28 languages. GG.BET is keen to capitalize on this audience and drive further engagement for its own brand while also exciting interest in competitive Counter-Strike.</p>
<p>Esports in general has been a double-edged sword for the betting industry. On the one hand, there are operators such as Pinnacle and Rivalry who have been mostly successful in bringing products to market that work and that are reliable and well-received. Yet, other operators, including Unikrn and Luckbox have had to scale down their B2C operations, struggling to turn a profit.</p>
