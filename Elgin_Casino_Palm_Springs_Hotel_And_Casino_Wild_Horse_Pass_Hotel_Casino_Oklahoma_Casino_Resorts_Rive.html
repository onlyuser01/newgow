    <h1>Elgin Casino Palm Springs Hotel And Casino Wild Horse Pass Hotel Casino Oklahoma Casino Resorts Rive</h1>

<p>On Friday November 25th I played in the casino named here and won several euros in one game. I also gave the 2x2000 euros to pay out, which either didn't match the deposit method or it was just put on hold but nothing was done. Well, as it is, you get money back to play and keep trying.</p>
<p>That's what I did, on November 27th. I played the Extra Bingo with a start of 1500 euros down to 735 euros.</p>
<p>Now the topic is what it's all about!</p>
<p>I changed the game and went to the "CASH ULTIMATE.</p>
<p>In the first bets, my stake was 5 euros. When I was down around 350 euros, I made a bet of 20 euros. On the third try, a winning process began, in which the display of CASH symbols climbed up a winning ladder. I got up to 100x the stake and the win of 2000 euros was displayed! I was happy that I got back to the initial state and wanted to give a part to the payout page when suddenly a sign came up with the inscription:</p>
<p>THE SITE WILL BE CLOSED DUE TO INACTIVITY: PLEASE RELOGIN</p>
<p>My reaction was opps, but before I knew it, the credit went back from 2001 euros to 735 euros! I signed up again but there was no more profit to be seen! I immediately contacted customer service and bad communication started because everything had to go through translator portals. A chat meeting is only possible in English. I was asked for a screenshot of the deposit process, game progress and history. And then came the next burner! Nothing was to be found. Only one season of a date from 19.11..! Even seasons on 25.11. made by me there were not listed. (Among other things, I played with my wife, who of course found this all very utopian.)</p>
<p>I kept trying to connect with quality online casino people. Via email or contact form or chat. Then came on 29.11. an answer from support woopwin. I am translating the original wording here from English into German!</p>
<p>English</p>
<p>"Hello Thorsten,</p>
<p>Good day! We hope this email finds you well!</p>
<p>We are contacting you today regarding your report about the game Cash Ultimate.</p>
<p>As per the review of our technical team, please be informed that if no bet has been recorded it's because you were already playing while being logged out. There was probably an issue with the pop-up about inactivity and you saw it with a delay.</p>
<p>However, we can be sure that all bets with real money are recorded and visible to us and on your end, thus if you don't see it it's because those bets were never placed with real money</p>
<p>German:</p>
<p>Hello Torsten,</p>
<p>Nice day! We hope this email reaches you well!</p>
<p>We are contacting you today regarding your review of the Cash Ultimate game.</p>
<p>Please note, as verified by our technical team, if no bet was recorded it is because you were already playing while you were logged out. There was probably a problem with the inactivity pop-up and you saw it with a delay.</p>
<p>However, we can be sure that all real money bets are recorded and visible to us and on your side. So if you don't see it, it's because these bets were never placed with real money.</p>
<p>So I see that I am told, yes, the program kicked you out, but unfortunately there was no notice. No matter bad luck!!</p>
<p>Since then, despite objecting to this statement from them and not accepting it, I have received nothing more from them as an answer.</p>
<p>I see rip-offs, even fraud against the customer.</p>
