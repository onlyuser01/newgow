<p>Alexa Grasso Defending Her Title on Mexican Independence Day</p>
<p>The next UFC event is honoring Mexico, which is why a number of Mexican fighters are booked for the event, hence the name Noche UFC. The Mexican UFC night is headlined by the fight in which Alexa Grasso is defending her title for the first time.</p>
<p>The Mexican fighter is locking horns with Valentina Shevchenko, who‚Äôs the fighter whom she took the championship belt from six months ago. Grasso was a huge underdog in that fight, and for nearly four rounds, it seemed the bookies were right.</p>

<p>Grasso was getting beaten up by her opponent, who also made four takedowns. But then, we saw the Grasso magic ‚Äì she did a neck crank on Shevchenko.</p>
<p>That was Grasso‚Äôs biggest win ever, although she did defeat a couple of other decent fighters in the past. She defeated Viviane Araujo (decision), Joanne Wood (submission), Maycee Barber (decision), and a few others.</p>
<p>Valentina Shevchenko Plotting Her Revenge</p>
<p>Valentina Shevchenko is one of the best active fighters in women‚Äôs MMA, possibly even the very best one. She‚Äôs got plenty of weapons in her arsenal, as well as incredible power, and a very high IQ. Shevchenko is 23-4 in her professional MMA career, with the loss to Grasso happening after nine straight wins.</p>
<p>Her other defeats happened against Amanda Nunes (two times) and Liz Carmouche. Nunes beat her by a decision each time, one of which was a split decision win. Her loss to Carmouche happened in a bantamweight fight. It happened by TKO after Shevchenko decided to retire from the fight after two rounds.</p>
<p>Alexa Grasso vs. Valentina Shevchenko 2 Prediction</p>
<p>Simply put, Valentina Shevchenko is a much better fighter than Alexa Grasso. Her loss six months ago shocked everyone, but we just can‚Äôt see the same happening again. She‚Äôs had plenty of time to prepare for revenge, and we‚Äôre almost 100% certain she will pull it off.</p>
<p>Pick: Valentina Shevchenko to win</p>
