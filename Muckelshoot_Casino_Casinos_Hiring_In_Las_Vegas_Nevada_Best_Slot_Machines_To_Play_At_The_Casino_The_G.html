<p>Gargantini will play an important role in cementing Better Collective as a leading brand in South American sports, CEO Hovmand-Stilling said</p>
<p>Better Collective, an ambitious digital sports media group, has reinforced its LATAM team with a new appointment. The company selected the experienced Terence Gargantini as its new country director for Brazil, tasking him with identifying new potential partnerships in the region and supporting the Better Collective’s local business.</p>
<p>Gargantini will assume his new role on June 15 and will work from the company’s new office in Rio de Janeiro. His addition is in line with Better Collective’s goal to expand in South America, which it described as an “important pillar” for its vision to become a leader in sports media.</p>
<p>Gargantini will bring valuable knowledge of the sports industry to the team. His experience in business and understanding of sports in South America will be invaluable to Better Collective’s expansion in the region.</p>
<p>The appointee has previously worked with the Brazilian National soccer team and all state regional federations. Gargantini is also experienced in sports media, having previously worked as a country director at ElevenSports, a streaming platform that is currently owned by DAZN Group. The hire’s prior experiences include a stint with FanHero and an 11-year tenure at Nike.</p>
<p>Gargantini’s first task will be to accompany the rest of Better Collective’s team to the upcoming SIGMA conference in Sao Paulo. His hands-on experience makes him a perfect fit for his new position.</p>
<p>Better Collective Needs More Experienced Individuals to Support Its Growth</p>
<p>The CEO of Better Collective South America, Simon Hovmand-Stilling, welcomed Terence Gargantini on board. Hovmand-Stilling praised the new hire’s knack for finding beneficial partnerships and understanding the sports media sector. The CEO noted that Gargantini will play an important role in cementing Better Collective as a leading brand in South American sports.</p>
<p>Localization will be absolutely key for Better Collective in South America. We are already building a strong understanding of the local sports fans so we can be more relevant for advertisers, both local and international ones that seek to establish a presence in this region. Simon Hovmand-Stilling, CEO, Better Collective South America</p>
<p>Because of its growth in the region, Better Collective needs more experienced people like Gargantini, Hovmand-Stilling concluded.</p>
<p>Gargantini also addressed his new role, saying that he is very excited to join Better Collective and its talented team.</p>
<p>I have much exciting work ahead of me in trying to help lead Better Collective’s South American strategy and operations as well as collaborating on business development efforts in order to continue entry into the legal iGaming market in South America, and to enhance Better Collective’s foothold in this exciting region. Terence Gargantini, country director of Brazil, Better Collective</p>
<p>Last month, Better Collective posted its financial results for the quarter that ended on March 31, highlighting a record-breaking performance.</p>
