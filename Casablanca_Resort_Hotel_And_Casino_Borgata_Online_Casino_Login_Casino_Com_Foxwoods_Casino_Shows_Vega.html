<p>Developer of online casino slot games PopOK Gaming announced today that its iGaming offering has successfully passed the certification process in Romania and will soon become available to players in the country.</p>
<p>Portfolio of Engaging Slots</p>
<p>Having received certification by the National Gambling Office in Romania, ONJN, the gaming catalog of PopOK Gaming, comprising 18 of the developer’s beloved games such as Yummy, Lost Treasure, Diamond Flash, 20 Hot Bar, Blazing Hot, and Lucky Jungle, as well as the firm’s Progressive Jackpot spanning four levels, are ready to hit the market in the country and capture the hearts of Romanian online casino players.</p>
<p>Commenting on the certification, Tsovinar Elchyan, gaming product manager at PopOK Gaming, could not hide his excitement that the firm’s games would soon become available to players in the region, hailing the news as a great start for the business that is seeking to build strong relationships with local online gaming operators and reach new heights together with its partners.</p>
<p>The certification granted by the national gambling regulator in Romania gives local players the needed level of assurance that the in-house developed game titles that PopOK Gaming would soon deploy in the market would provide a secure gaming environment for their online gaming experience.</p>
<p>For operators, the certificate acquisition means that they can partner with the game developer and offer PopOK Gaming’s high-quality gaming solutions to its customers.</p>
<p>Gradually Expanding in Europe</p>
<p>The certification in Romania followed less than a month after PopOK Gaming had received a certification for its online casino games in the UK, meaning that the developer had achieved compliance with all the requirements of the UK gambling regulator and was green-lighted to start offering its games in the country.</p>
<p>Also in July, PopOK Gaming participated in the 2022 IGB Live event in Amsterdam and showcased its portfolio of online game titles, including head-turning slots such as Goddesses of Zeus, Vikings Mystery, Lucky Smile, Crazy Poki, and many others, as well the firm’s new Live Casino with first ever Fruit Roulette.</p>
<p>Outside of Europe, PopOK Gaming participated in the Peru Gaming Show which took place in the Latin American country in June, where it presented over 35 slot game titles and offered them to operators via swift integration. The firm’s new Live Casino and Fruit Roulette were also showcased to operators and guest of the show.</p>
