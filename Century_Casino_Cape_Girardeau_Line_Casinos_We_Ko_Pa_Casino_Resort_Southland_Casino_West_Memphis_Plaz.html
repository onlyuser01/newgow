    <h1>Century Casino Cape Girardeau Line Casinos We Ko Pa Casino Resort Southland Casino West Memphis Plaz</h1>

<p>Online casino brand PlayStar announced today its senior management team would have a new addition following the appointment of Gustav Vadenbring as the brand’s chief financial officer (CFO).</p>
<p>‘Major Coup’</p>
<p>The appointment of industry veteran Vadenbring to the online casino brand effective January 10, 2022, is coming during a period in which final preparations for the brand’s launch in New Jersey are taking place. PlayStar teamed up with Ocean Casino Resort in a multi-year partnership deal to gain market access in the Garden State earlier this year and then reached for the assistance of global hosting provider Internet Vikings.</p>
<p>Bringing more than 20 years of experience in merger and acquisition (M&amp;A), initial public offerings (IPOs) and company developments, the addition of Vadenbring is “a major coup” for the company, PlayStar CEO Per Hellberg outlined, stressing the high hopes the company places on Vadenbring’s expertise to help it achieve its goal to become “the preferred online casino brand in New Jersey and beyond.”</p>
<p>As a challenger brand it is important that we maintain tight control over our finances while also securing additional investment as and when required, and in Gustav, we have someone that is beyond qualified for the job.” Per Hellberg, CEO, PlayStar</p>
<p>Vadenburg is set to join PlayStar from gambling affiliate Acroud, formerly known as Net Gaming, where he has been performing in a chief financial officer role since 2018. His professional resume also includes senior financial roles at Actic Group, Deloitte and SEB.</p>
<p>Financial Oversight</p>
<p>Speaking about his upcoming role, Vadenbring noted he realized he had to accept the offer and join PlayStar and its experienced team and help the brand build from the ground up. In his new role, Vadenbring will be tasked with oversight of all financial aspects of the business as it embarks on a journey to becoming a major player in the North American online casino market.</p>
<p>“This is a bold and ambitious company that is looking to disrupt the status quo with an online casino brand and player experience the likes of which have never been seen before in North America and indeed the world,” Vadenbring outlined, expressing his excitement of joining the team and becoming a part of the company’s future success.</p>
<p>Vadenbring is the latest high-profile appointment at PlayStar following the additions of Hellberg in March and COO Dan Alexander in June. Hellberg joined the company from affiliate Catena Media, while Alexander left his role as Head of Casino at bet365 to accept the new challenge.</p>
