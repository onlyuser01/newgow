    <h1>Venetian Palazzo Resort Hotel Casinos Live Casino Careers Bally Casino Promo Code Mgm Detroit Casino</h1>

<p>Hello, I had a problem with this house, what I earned was in sports betting, they took away my winnings, according to them for abusing a bonus, to begin with, there is no bonus abuse if the user continues betting after fulfilling the rollover, my withdrawal was because I they limited, I deposited 110 dollars, I don't remember if it was the maximum bonus they gave, but one of the reasons they argued was that I use the maximum bonus, which lacks much foundation, many use the maximum bonus of a house, the next The point is that I bet all my money on odds of 2 or more, betting all my money was because the house lacked many games and when I saw it, I put everything in, I think it's normal that several should do it, and the installment 2 is one of the rules of the bonus, it seemed like a joke that they said that as an excuse, another point was according to them that I kept using the same installment pattern 2 or more, hahahahaha and it was the same, I think they didn't even know which was a bonus requirement, and I changed employers because and first I bet on basketball and then I went for soccer, so they are not right there, when I fulfilled the rollover I obtained an approximate of 700 dollars, I continued playing as I mentioned and already the master dial of quota 2 left it, because it was a bonus rule, now my bets were lower than 1.80 or 1.90, finally I got 2009.55, and I was surprised that they limited me, so I want to withdraw, but they canceled my withdrawal, I didn't know why, I had to ask, and they told me of my documents, I uploaded them and when there was a rejection, they didn't even tell me the reason I had to ask, the whole verification process took a month, it was very tedious, finally when I withdraw, I get the message that they take away my earnings according to them for bonus abuse, when I already explained before that it is not, mainly because I continue betting when I have already fulfilled the rollover, they argue these reasons</p>
<p>i) a single deposit to receive the MAX bonus offered.</p>
<p>ii) Start your betting activity with a single bet, Football Pre Event, Bet = your deposit + bonus money, at high odds (greater than 2)</p>
<p>iii) Start your betting activity with simple bets, Pre-event football, Total bets = your deposit + bonus money, at high odds (greater than 2)</p>
<p>iv) Continue your betting activity in the same pattern as mentioned above, with bets = winnings from the first bet(s)</p>
<p>As I already explained, they are not sufficient reasons to allege a bonus abuse and based solely on the fact that they put as an excuse the quota 2 that was a bonus requirement hahaha</p>
<p>And to finish, why didn't they take away the earnings from my bonus, when I finish fulfilling it? that it was at the beginning of the year when I had barely 700 and I didn't have to wait when I already had 2000 and wanted to withdraw, also there was about 30 days verifying my account, they could easily tell me, but since they couldn't find an excuse they had to tell me at the end, I repeat I don't think so a bonus abuse, I bet a lot of money between all my bets, to get from 100 to more than 2000</p>
