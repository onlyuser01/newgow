    <h1>Casino Royale Novel Winstar World Casino Oklahoma Casino In Ga Casino Games For Android Phone Sweep</h1>

<p>Dear olveraberenice27,</p>
<p>Although the casino has not responded to the complaint yet, in the meantime, I consulted the matter internally with the team, and our final decision was made.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after gathering all the necessary information and the outcome of our internal discussion, we are closing this complaint as unjustified. Since the case is very specific, I would like to explain why.</p>
<p>Although it is a non-standard no-deposit bonus that significantly differs from no-deposit bonuses as we usually know them, we are talking about free money given by the casino, so we accept that they set terms and conditions as they see fit. Each player is obliged to read the terms and conditions, and you accepted them upon registration or claiming the no-deposit bonus.</p>
<p>My colleague Veronika shared the specific rules for the bonus above. They clearly say that the winnings from this bonus are not withdrawable and can only be used to complete the wagering requirements of the next deposit bonus. There is no other way how to use these winnings since they are intended for further play with a deposit bonus. If you did not accept the deposit bonus, as you claimed in your first post, it does not change anything - the disputed $2,500 just would not have been available to use and would be stuck in your account. Like this, it should help you to meet the wagering requirements of the deposit bonus used after.</p>
<p>Basically, despite the fact it is a very unusual no-deposit bonus, the casino acted in accordance with its terms and conditions for the specific bonus, and therefore, we are able to accept it as it relates to no-deposit bonus/free money. However, please note we took it into consideration upon updating the casino's review and rating, and those were adjusted according to the above-mentioned facts.</p>
<p>In case you would like to cancel the deposit bonus from your account, I am sure the casino's customer support will be at your assistance, but then it will not be possible to use the winnings accumulated from the no-deposit bonus.</p>
<p>I am sorry we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that the casino is regulated by. In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Branislav, Casino.Guru</p>
