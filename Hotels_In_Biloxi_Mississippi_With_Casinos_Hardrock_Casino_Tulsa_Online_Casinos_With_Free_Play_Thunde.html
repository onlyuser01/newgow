    <h1>Hotels In Biloxi Mississippi With Casinos Hardrock Casino Tulsa Online Casinos With Free Play Thunde</h1>

<p>Good morning, I have already completed the account verification and my account has been fully verified. I have not withdrawn money from the site previosuly, however when I emailed on the 27th October syaing can my account be closed down, I relaised I had £340 funds to withdraw so i clicked withdraw. Now I then logged out and when I went to log back in to make sure my withdrawal request is going through, I got an email saying as per your request we have now closed your account for you. I have checked and it clearly states of their websites terms and conditions that in the event a player has requested the casino close their account we will subject to paragraph 10.3, return any outstanding balance in your account to you. All I want is my money paid to me, Im happy to keep my account closed as they only allow £500 withdrawal at a time and take weeks to process the withdrawal, because of this I lost 1k that I had as I got fed up of waiting for the money to be sent to me. once they process the withdrawal and I get my money, I am happy to never use the casino again as its just hassle. I shouldn't have to chase them all day, they know I had money in my balance why not just return it to me. Thanks for getting back to me quickly, kind regards.</p>
