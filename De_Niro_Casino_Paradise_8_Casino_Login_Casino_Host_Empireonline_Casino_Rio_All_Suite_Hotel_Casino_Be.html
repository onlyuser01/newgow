<p>Leading sports betting operator BetMGM and the Washington Nationals entered into a multi-year exclusive partnership, the Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise announced today.</p>
<p>“The Nationals are thrilled to expand our strong partnership with MGM Resorts into the sports betting realm.” Alan Gottlieb, Chief Operating Officer, Lerner Sports Group</p>
<p>BetMGM Sportsbook at the Nationals Park</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, a BetMGM Sportsbook connected to the Nationals Park would be opened, while a mobile sports betting app would be launched for the area around the stadium. A number of fan-focused campaigns as well as co-branding opportunities would also feature in the partnership between the sports betting operator and the professional baseball franchise.</p>
<p>“As our Official Sports Betting Partner, BetMGM will further enhance the greatest in-venue fan experience in Washington, D.C. through its state-of-the-art entertainment products and services.” Alan Gottlieb, Chief Operating Officer, Lerner Sports Group</p>
<p>The BetMGM Sportsbook that will be located in the space which now hosts Center Field Social, across Center Field Plaza from the Nationals Team Score, will provide an exquisite viewing paired with sports betting experience, to complement the offering of MGM National Harbor Dugout Club, the 8 luxury seats located on the field adjacent to the dugout.</p>
<p>“The BetMGM mobile app will enable our fans to engage with the game in new and exciting ways, while the BetMGM Sportsbook connected to Nationals Park will provide Nationals fans and the D.C. community with a first-class gathering place to celebrate their passion for sports together.” Alan Gottlieb, Chief Operating Officer, Lerner Sports Group</p>
<p>BetMGM Mobile App Rolled Out</p>
<p>Fans will not have access to the BetMGM Sportsbook while they are in attendance at the stadium, but those of them willing to place a bet would be able to do that via BetMGM’s mobile app.</p>
<p>“This new partnership with the Nationals is our most in-depth partnership with a team and showcases the multitude of ways we’re able to engage fans in and out of stadiums. We’re extremely excited to work together to create unique experiences for Nationals fans and the broader D.C. metro area during and after games.” Matt Prevost, Chief Revenue Officer, BetMGM</p>
<p>Under the partnership deal, BetMGM becomes the Official Sports Betting Partner of the Washington Nationals and would have its branding featured inside the home of the MLB franchise, as well as on the team’s social and digital platforms.</p>
<p>Both parties would also collaborate to offer exclusive benefits for the members of each partner’s loyalty programs, M life Rewards for BetMGM and Red Carpet Rewards for the Nationals.</p>
<p>Seen as the best way to extend MGM National Harbor’s partnership with the Washington Nationals, the deal would allow sports fans to experience “America’s pastime in the most innovative and exciting way”, Jorge Perez, president and chief operating officer at MGM National Harbor outlined.</p>
<p>The partnership with the Nationals expands on recent high-profile deals BetMGM signed with professional franchises. In November, BetMGM teamed up with the National Football League (NFL) franchise Pittsburg Steelers, followed by a partnership with Philadelphia 76ers from the National Basketball League (NBA) in December.</p>
