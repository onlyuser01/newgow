<p>The company selected Rod Centers for the role of chief operating office, tasking him with overseeing three gaming properties in New York</p>
<p>The leading entertainment and gaming company, established by the Seneca Nation of Indians to operate, develop and finance its gaming facilities, Seneca Gaming Corporation, has announced a new C-suite hire. The company confirmed it appointed Rod Centers, a seasoned executive with more than three decades of experience, to the role of chief operating officer (COO), a recent report released by Olean Times Herald suggests.</p>
<p>In his new role with Seneca Gaming, the gaming industry veteran is expected to play a key role by overseeing strategic operations and helping the company’s teams develop and implement different initiatives that seek to propel growth and improve efficiency. As COO, Centers will oversee the operations of three Seneca Gaming properties.</p>
<p>Those properties include Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino, Seneca Allegany as well as Seneca Niagara Casino and Hotel. All those locations are currently operated and owned by the Seneca Nation and represent an important part of their portfolio.</p>
<p>The latest senior-level appointment comes at a time when Seneca Nation’s gaming compact with the state of New York is set to expire in December. While negotiations continue, the Tribal operator wants to ensure fair conditions for the new gaming compact that will enable it to offer its casino games for the next two decades.</p>
<p>Yet, earlier this month, non-native casinos, racinos and unions announced the forming of a coalition that called for an unbiased gaming compact between New York and the Seneca Nation. The Fair Compact for All Coalition represented workers and non-tribal casino operators who wanted assurances that the new tribal gaming compact would not impact the commercial gaming and racing sector.</p>
<p>Centers Is Delighted to Join Seneca Gaming</p>
<p>Focusing once again on the recent hire, Centers brings more than three decades of experience after holding senior-level roles within the hospitality and gaming sector, as well as other important industries. He is a proven leader with a track record and has held C-suite roles with leading gaming companies, including Caesars, Penn National and JACK Entertainment, among others.</p>
<p>“Seneca Gaming Corporation is a dynamic company, and their three world-class properties occupy an important role in the gaming market.“ Rod Centers, COO at Seneca Gaming</p>
<p>Sharing his excitement, Centers said that he will be thrilled to oversee the operations of the three New York venues. He added that he is looking forward to collaborating with the company’s C-suite to ensure the venues retain a growth trajectory.</p>
<p>“Rod has a keen understanding and proven ability to identify operational efficiencies and to help organizations implement improvement measures that, in turn, help maximize results.“ Kevin Nephew, CEO and president at Seneca Gaming</p>
<p>Kevin Nephew, Seneca Gaming’s CEO and president, praised the expert knowledge and deep understanding Centers has. The CEO and president predicted that the new COO would play an important role in the company’s growth in the region. Finally, Nephew said he is looking forward to the success Centers’ appointment will bring.</p>
