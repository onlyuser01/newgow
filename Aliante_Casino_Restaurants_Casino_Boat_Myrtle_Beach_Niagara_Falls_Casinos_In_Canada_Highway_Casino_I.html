<p>James Browne, the Minister of State in charge of Law Reform in Ireland, announced the appointment of Anne Marie Caulfield as the boss of the new Gambling Regulatory Authority in the country. In her new position as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Designate of the Gambling Regulatory Authority, Caulfield is expected to spearhead its operation in the country.</p>
<p>Currently, lawmakers are preparing the necessary legislation for the establishment of the new authority. A publication of the proposal is expected to emerge at some point this autumn. This will mark the first step toward the introduction of the new gambling authority.</p>
<p>According to the Department of Justice, the new government body is expected to become operational at some point next year. As CEO Designate, Caulfield is also expected to minimize "the time between the enactment of the legislation and the date on which the regulator commences operations." To ensure a smooth process, the Department of Justice also created a specialized Board that will be scrutinizing the process.</p>
<p>In a statement released on September 8, 2022, Caulfield acknowledged that it is a privilege to become the CEO Designate of the Gambling Regulatory Authority in Ireland. She added that both efficient and effective regulation is incredibly important for the sector, which is why a solid framework is needed.</p>
<p>"The Authority must be built on a foundation of robust legislation and I welcome the progress to date of the draft Gambling Regulation Bill," said Caulfield. Last but not least she said that she is looking forward to establishing a strong work relationship with the involved stakeholders in the industry, officials from the Department of Justice, as well as other gambling regulators in Europe.</p>
<p>Minister Browne added that he is delighted to see Ms. Caulfield as the CEO Designate. He acknowledged that she brings significant experience which will help her with her role. "The appointment of the CEO Designate is an important milestone in the future establishment of the Gambling Regulatory Authority, advancing a key Programme for Government commitment," explained Minister Browne.</p>
<p>According to him, the idea of having greater regulation of the gambling industry in the country is not new. However, Minister Browne stressed that this is one of his key priorities. Speaking about the new gambling authority, he predicted it will make a difference and help reduce the rate of problem gambling and ultimately prevent harm.</p>
<p>Minister Browne added that Caulfield's supervision of the drafting of the legislation will ensure its effectiveness once it is up and running. Last but not least, he pointed out that she is collaborating with the Department of Justice to "identify staffing and resourcing needs and to develop procedures for how the Authority will function once operational."</p>
