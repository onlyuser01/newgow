<p>Lionel Messi is making his Inter Miami debut on Friday, July 21, 2023. The Messiah and his new team take on Cruz Azul at DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, FL, in the first round of the 2023 Leagues Cup</p>
<p>The soccer GOAT Lionel Messi is expected to make his debut in the Inter Miami shirt on Friday, July 21, against Cruz Azul in the 2023 Leagues Cup. But he’s not the only one – the former Barcelona captain Sergio Busquets might do the same. As a result, the two of them would get reunited with the ex-Barca coach Gerardo “Tata” Martino.</p>
<p>All this has made Inter Miami one of the favorites to win the Leagues Cup. Further, this team’s odds in the Cruz Azul game have shortened from +150 to +112.</p>

<p>Lionel Messi to End Inter Miami’s Horrible Run</p>
<p>Inter Miami has won only one game since May, and it happened in the US Open Cup, against Birmingham Legion FC, a team from Division II of the US soccer league system (USL Championship). However, good days seem to be on the horizon for these guys.</p>

<p>It’s mainly because of the arrival of Lionel Messi. The best soccer player in history is likely to make a huge impact as soon as he starts playing for “The Herons.” The best thing is that he’s not the only one who’s going to make the David Beckham-owned team much stronger.</p>
<p>Midfield general Sergio Busquets has also decided to join Inter Miami, where he and Messi will get to work again with coach Tata Martino.</p>
<p>Cruz Azul Just Isn’t Playing Great Right Now</p>
<p>This team is on zero points in the Mexican Liga MX Apertura after three rounds. These guys lost all three of their games in the league, scoring just one goal along the way and conceding six.</p>
<p>Last season, however, they were better. In the 2022-23 Clausura, they finished eight in the regular season, then went on to lose to Atlas in the first round of the playoffs. Cruz Azul’s standout player in the Clausura was Uriel Antuna, but he might miss the first game of the 2023 Leagues Cup.</p>
<p>The thing is that he might need some time to rest after taking part in the Gold Cup with the Mexico national team, which won the trophy last Sunday. If he plays against Inter Miami on Friday, it’s going to be his first game in the Cruz Azul shirt since early May.</p>
<p>Inter Miami vs. Cruz Azul Prediction</p>
<p>Even without Messi and Busquets on the pitch, and Martino in the dugout, “The Herons” would still stand a good chance against Cruz Azul, which is just a mediocre Liga MX side. However, with the new additions to the team, Inter Miami looks destined to run riot on its opposition this Friday.</p>
<p>Pick: Inter Miami to win &amp; over 2.5 goals</p>
