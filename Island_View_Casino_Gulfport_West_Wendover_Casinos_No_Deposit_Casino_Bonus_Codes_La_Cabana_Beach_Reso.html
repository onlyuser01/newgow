<p>The intaitive is a new resource for the gambling industry and its regulators an will help steer the future of operators and businesses, as well as the entities involved with regulating gambling</p>
<p>Simo Dragicevic and Sarah Ramanauskas have joined forces to launch a new safer gambling initiative for the gambling industry. The Game Safety Institute will provide a centre of knowledge for new and practical insight into gambling products.</p>
<p>Simo says: “Much of the focus of regulators, research and policy has been upon players, including their characteristics and behaviour. Less attention has been directed to the nature of the product and the complex interrelation between player characteristics and contextual factors. The Game Safety Institute will address this gap.”</p>
<p>Sarah says: “We believe the gambling industry and its regulators need to extend and improve their understanding of product risks and how best to mitigate these risks, in order to further help players avoid potential harms. Our aim is to provide actionable insight for gambling operators and regulators looking to ensure product safety is developed as an integral part of safer gambling.”</p>
<p>Dragicevic has been a technology entrepreneur and product lead in the gambling industry since 2010, starting with BetBuddy, a pioneer in data analytics and responsible gambling, which was acquired by Playtech Plc in 2017. He is on the board of Canada’s Responsible Gambling Council and sits on the GB Gambling Commission’s Digital Advisory Panel.</p>
<p>Ramanauskas has provided responsible gambling consultancy services to gambling operators and regulators globally since 2014. She is currently an assessor for both the World Lottery Association and the US National Council on Problem Gambling. She has also recently served as a Commissioner on the UK Commission on Crime and Gambling-Related Harms. She previously held senior research and insight roles at Betfair and William Hill.</p>
