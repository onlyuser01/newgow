<p>The leading iGaming technology, solutions and services provider, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), announced a new collaboration with Merkur, the famous German-based operator. The new compliance partnership was announced Tuesday and sees GiG provide its affiliate marketing compliance tool called GiG Comply for Merkur.</p>
<p>In a statement released on September 27, 2022, the company's Affiliate Lead, Martin Collins, said: "With everything we do here at Merkur Partners we aim to do it right, especially when it comes to compliance." He explained that the company's brands are operated locally by licensed operators that also seek to comply with both online and offline rules. Collins acknowledged that GiG and Merkur have significant knowledge within the iGmaing industry. He deemed GiG a strategic partner for the company and predicted success for the new compliance partnership.</p>
<p>The leading automated compliance tool helps operators comply with regulations in different jurisdictions. This is achieved by enabling operators to customize the requirements and compliance parameters to match specific market needs. Without any doubt, this function of the automated compliance tool will help Merkur considering it currently operates in multiple key markets.</p>
<p>Jonas Warrer, GiG's Chief Marketing Officer, shared his excitement by saying: "It's important that GiG Comply will continue to help Merkur, as it does our other partners, to remain proactive and in control of its marketing compliance." In conclusion, he pointed out that GiG is delighted to ensure the compliance of Merkur's affiliates.</p>
<p>A key market that GiG Comply will assist with is the one in Germany. Currently, the iGaming industry in the country is strictly regulated which means that operators such as Merkur need to ensure their compliance and the compliance of their brands. Ultimately, complying with the rules protects the brands from breaches as well as regulatory sanctions such as fines.</p>
<p>According to GiG, its automated compliance tool operates by scanning of web pages for "content including links, iGaming code red words and regulatory requirements" within different jurisdictions. Afterward, the solution uses a "rules engine to analyze real snapshots from affiliates' campaigns and provides operators with the promotional content that is being used in their brands' promotions," GiG explains.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, GiG unveiled plans for further investment in North America. The company revealed its plans to create a new US-facing hub that will be led by Ben Clemes, who will be taking the position of President of GiG North America. With this move, the company seeks to further grow into the US market since its initial entry back in 2018.</p>
