<p>Crown Resorts, which was recently purchased by Blackstone, has announced that it appointed Mark McWhinnie as Crown Sydney’s new CEO. McWhinnie brings over 4 decades of working experience in Australia, Asia and the Pacific and his appointment is subject to regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>McWhinnie Joins Crown Sydney From Sands China</p>
<p>Before being appointed as Crown Sydney’s CEO, McWhinnie spent more than 13 years in a senior leadership position at Sands China. He was in charge of overseeing the operations of 8 hotels. His success led to him being awarded the LEED silver certification (sustainable practices in design and construction).</p>
<p>McWhinnie will be replacing Simon McGrath, who is set to leave at the end of September. McGrath is known for overseeing the opening of the first Australian VIP-only casino.</p>
<p>Sharing his thoughts on the appointment, McWhinnie praised both Crown Sydney and Crown Resorts. He stated that Crown Sydney is a “world-class integrated resort.” He added that Crown Resorts has a reputation as an industry leader and that he’s looking forward to building on that reputation and playing his part in promoting responsible gambling.</p>
<p>McWhinnie considers Sydney as the “gateway to Australia” and that is why Crown Sydney has a massive role to play in reimbursing in both tourism and hospitality sectors.</p>
<p>Ciarán Carruthers, the CEO of Crown Resorts, also shared a few words on McWhinnie’s appointment. He stated that McWhinnie is a globally renowned executive that has massive knowledge in both hospitality and gaming. He added that he’s delighted to welcome him on board and that his appointment is a testament to the resort’s “ability to attract strong talent.”</p>
<p>Crown Sydney Opened Its VIP Casino After Gaining a Conditional License</p>
<p>After being under investigation for a full year, Crown Sydney gained a conditional license back in June. The casino was deemed unfit to hold a license and the conditional one is set to expire on December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>After opening its doors, Crown Sydney opened its VIP casino at the start of August. VIP players can choose between the Mahogany Room and the Crystal Room. However, the Mahogany Room is still under construction and is set to open in October.</p>
<p>Twelve private Sky Salons are also featured on the 28th and 29th levels. While speaking to 9 News, McGrath stated that the VIP gaming floor is the only of its kind in Australia and all guests that want to be members of the club need to undergo comprehensive checks.</p>
<p>Additionally, each visitor needs to be a member of Crown’s program or “guest of a member,” as McGrath pointed out. As a concluding note, McGrath noted that the interest in membership has exceeded the expectations of the business.</p>
