<p>The MPs wagered £50 each, backing various Grand National horses and committing their winnings to a charity cause of their choice</p>
<p>Over 40 British MPs from both sides of the House have demonstrated their support for the Betting and Gaming Council’s Charity Bet Campaign. To that end, they visited local betting shops to place a BGC Charity Bet on the Grand National race.</p>
<p>The BGC said that parliamentary participants include Levelling Up Minister Dehenna Davison MP, Shadow DCMS Minister Alex Davies-Jones MP, Minister for Enterprise Kevin Hollinrake, COP26 President Alok Sharma MP, Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey, former Labour Cabinet Minister John Spellar, former DCMS Minister Caroline Dinenage MP and Shadow Apprenticeships Minister Toby Perkins, among others.</p>
<p>As reported by the BGC, the MPs wagered £50 to back a participant in one of the most popular steeplechase events in the world. As per the campaign, all the winnings will go toward a charity picked by the bettors.</p>
<p>In the case an MP’s horse doesn’t win, the BGC promised to donate £250 to the charity chosen by the politician, ensuring that the cause will receive funding.</p>
<p>The BGC hosts this charity initiative each year. Last year’s edition, for example, raised around £11,000 ($13,800) for a range of charity organizations.</p>
<p>The Event Will Attract Millions of Bettors</p>
<p>The annual race at Aintree, Liverpool, is the most popular horseracing event in the world. This year’s edition is scheduled for April 15 and will be watched by an estimated 600 million people across 140 countries. The BGC estimates bets from at least 13 million UK adults.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the commission predicts that around $313 million will be staked on the main event. This will translate into $3.7 million in tax revenues and $2.5 million in horse racing levy which will support the sector.</p>
<p>Michael Dugher, the BGC’s chief executive officer, commented on the matter, saying that the highly-anticipated Grand National event will welcome millions of sports fans and bettors. He noted that betting is a huge source of jobs and revenue in the United Kingdom. In addition, Dugher said that betting shops provide a community to countless betting aficionados.</p>
<p>Dugher thanked all the MPs who participated in the charity campaign:</p>
<p>I also want to say a huge thanks to the MPs who have made the time and effort to meet with their local constituents working in high street shops, for backing so many good causes and local charities, and for promoting the Grand National which remains one of Britain’s biggest and best cultural and sporting events seen around the world. Michael Dugher, CEO, BGC</p>
<p>In other news, the BGC recently said that it may support the proposed RET levy if land-based operators are protected.</p>
