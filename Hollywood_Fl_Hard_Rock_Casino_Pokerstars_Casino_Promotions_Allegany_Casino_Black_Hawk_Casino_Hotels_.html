<p>GiG and Playtech have signed a fresh partnership according to which GiG will now offer online poker with the help of Playtech’s iPoker Network.</p>
<p>Playtech Extends iPoker Network to GiG’s Network of Partners</p>
<p>Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), an established leader in the iGaming vertical, has announced that it has integrated Playtech’s award-winning poker platform, the iPoker Network, as part of its own network, and thus strengthened its offer with existing partners. The move marks a pivotal partnership for GiG, as this is the company’s first inroad in the online poker space.</p>
<p>The company has bet on Playtech’s iPoker as a solution that balances between different iGaming verticals and already reunites some 35,000 players in the poker segment alone, making for one of the largest poker networks. Previously, Sweden-based Enlabs AB decided to migrate from GG Network to Playtech’s iPoker, showing the network’s growing popularity and reach.</p>
<p>Playtech supports poker products in the majority of regulated markets around the globe with more licenses down the pipeline. Moving forward, any GiG partner will have access to a broad variety of poker games, including Omaha, Omaha Hi/Lo, 6-Plus Hold’em, various Sit &amp; Go’s and, not least, the most popular competitive version of the game, Texas Hold’em.</p>
<p>The iPoker Network has been fully optimized to run smoothly on any device, thanks to its HTML5 software architecture, meaning Android and iOS clients can access the offer freely. GiG has added some of its own handy work to the platform, enriching it with GiG’s microservices options in a bid to create a more flexible, scalable and richer product.</p>
<p>The current partnership has been described as great success by both GiG and Playtech’s top brass. Ben Clemes, CCO at GiG, argued that the integration of Playtech’s iPoker Network with GiG’s iGaming platform would expand the existing options for GiG’s network partners, and help boost the user experience.</p>
<p>“As part of the process, we added to our microservices, which gives us the ability to scale and integrate with other third-party poker providers in the future —providing our partners with more flexibility and choice.’’</p>
<p>Playtech Chief Operating Officer Shimon Akad said that Playtech was delighted to have teamed up with GiG. Akad noted that Playtech had invested heavily into developing a platform that not only works on web, but is available as a dedicated downloadable client and a native poker app.</p>
<p>Together with GiG, Akad said, operators will have a chance to enjoy an “exceptionally flexible platform” which will spearhead growth in the network. GiG will remain an important strategic partner for Playtech, the executive continued, and the company is now looking forward to collaborating on more projects with it.</p>
<p>Previously, GiG signed up a deal with 1×2 Network, extending the network’s offer with virtual sports.</p>
