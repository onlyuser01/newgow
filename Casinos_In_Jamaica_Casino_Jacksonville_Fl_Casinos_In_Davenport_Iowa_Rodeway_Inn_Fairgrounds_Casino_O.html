<p>Betsson has secured an extension of its Liga 1 naming rights agreement with the Peruvian Football Federation</p>
<p>Global online gaming and sports betting operator Betsson will continue to support sports in Peru while promoting safer gambling. To that end, the gambling company has extended its naming rights agreement with the Peruvian Football Federation (FPF) by four more years.</p>
<p>Betsson Extends Liga 1 Naming Rights by Four Years</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Betsson will retain naming rights for the top-tier division of professional soccer in Peru. This will allow the operator to continue promoting pro sporting events while promoting responsible sports betting at the same time.</p>
<p>As a result of the deal, Peru’s Liga 1 will be known as Liga 1 Betsson throughout the 2023 season. The operator, meanwhile, will retain the right to feature Liga 1 imagery across its media channels. This would mark yet another year Betsson has supported Peruvian soccer, as the operator and FPF first joined forces several years ago.</p>
<p>The agreement extension comes right ahead of the Apertura Tournament and will see Betsson and the FPF work on making it the best edition yet. As the fan-favorite event approaches, the operator will double down on its efforts to promote responsible gaming under the #JuegoResponsable hashtag.</p>
<p>Betsson Is Committed to Supporting Pro Soccer</p>
<p>Héctor Lara, FPF’s director of competitions, commented on the agreement. Lara said that it is exciting that a brand such as Betsson expresses interest in the Peruvian league. Such sponsorships, Lara noted, allow FPF to continue “optimizing the economic value” of the Liga 1 and expanding its reach. It also allows the federation to invest in developing the soccer structure and nurturing young talents.</p>
<p>As the FPF, we are committed to elevating Peruvian soccer to its rightful place, and we are dedicated to this goal. We are constantly working to achieve this. Héctor Lara, director of competitions, FPF</p>
<p>Ronni Hartvig, Betsson’s chief commercial officer, also spoke on the matter. He said that the partnership extension fills his team with lots of pride and added that he is excited to “continue the journey Betsson and the FPF started in 2020. Hartvig noted that this attests to the operator’s intentions to support national professional soccer.</p>
<p>Additionally, by being the proud naming sponsor of the Liga1, we are able to emphasize our passion for sports and our commitment to football fan engagement – values that Betsson shares with the FPF. Ronni Hartvig, CCO, Betsson</p>
<p>Hartvig concluded that Betsson’s team is excitedly waiting for the next soccer season to start. He promised that his company has a lot in store for fans of soccer and sports betting.</p>
<p>Last month, Betsson teamed up with Religa, adding its Triple Way Roulette to its portfolio.</p>
