<p>Play’n GO has announced it has reached close to 250 million daily rounds played on November 1, marking a new record for the company</p>
<p>The pioneer business-to-business online slots provider that recognized the potential of “gaming on the GO” almost two decades ago, Play’n GO, has announced that it has broken its record for the number of rounds played in a day.</p>
<p>The Swedish-based developer of some of the most iconic, frequently-played online casino games in history, including the Book of Dead series, Reactoonz, or Moon Princess, has reached almost 250 million rounds played on November 1, 2023.</p>
<p>The figure marks an all-time high for the studio since it first opened its virtual gates to the public in 2005. The number underlies the “enduring strength of the company” as well as their ongoing expansion across global regulated gaming markets.</p>
<p>At the moment, the company’s 300 premium games are delivered to casino operators in over 25 global jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Breaking Records, a “Testament” to Play’n GO’s Hard Work</p>
<p>The company’s chief commercial officer, Magnus Olsson, commented on the new record,</p>
<p>describing it as “a testament to the hard work of everyone at Play’n GO” as well as worldwide players’ appetite for their games.</p>
<p>Olsson also explained the impressive record reached by the company through their excellent selection of titles that keep being “extremely sticky with the millions of unique players” who enjoy playing them on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The CCO took the opportunity to mention the upcoming release of blockbuster titles like Gargantoonz, which is their latest addition to the popular Reactoonz series launched almost a decade ago, and which is also expected to help them finish the year with even more impressive records.</p>
<p>Olsson also expressed his feelings of pride regarding the work of the entire team, calling it “brilliant” to be rewarded with a new all-time high.</p>
<p>More Than One Million Daily Players</p>
<p>Play’n GO’s titles are played by over one million players on a daily basis. The freshly announced record follows a number of impressive achievements that were attained by the company in recent months.</p>
<p>The list includes the highly-anticipated release with important Tier 1 customers like BetMGM via the New Jersey launch, Sisal, Sky, Betway, or BeyondPlay, or foraying into a land-based environment for the first time in history with the launch of the iconic Book of Dead game with William Hill in the UK.</p>
<p>Play’n GO has also been busy scooping up new licenses in US states that have embraced iGaming, including the AGCO license for Ontario while preparing the launch of Network Leaderboard promotions at a worldwide level across a number of countries and gaming operators.</p>
