    <h1>Casino In Cherokee Nc Legends Casino Buffet Online Live Casinos Casino Night Rentals Hollywood Casin</h1>

<p>Hello ,</p>
<p>I am himesh and I was played in juicy vegas, I deposit amount 503$ through the BTC wallet in binance but the transection not showing on my casino account 31/05/2023.then I checked my transection it says on block chain confirmed and sucessfully. I send email with my all the proof I have about transection to juicy vegas finance team. They checked my proof and reply me there are no transection through this wallet address and they send me link to going direct to the transection on block chair.then I realized what happen and I go through that link I found they checked, there are two wallets in my binance ,</p>
<p>1.BITCOIN</p>
<p>2.BITCOIN CASH</p>
<p>same wallet address show this two wallet types they are go through</p>
<p>my (BITCOIN CASH) wallet and not the the (BITCOIN )wallet, because I deposit through my BITCOIN wallet this transection.</p>
<p>Then I reply that email please check my BITCOIN wallet address then you can find my 31/05/2023 transection on the block chain.and I mention my prof receipts and documents clearly mention transection sucessfull statement and they were checked my BITCOIN CASH address so please go through my BITCOIN address then you can find my transection. But After few hours I was waiting to my deposit and I try to log in my account there was blocked from finance management. I can't log to my account. I chat with coustomer represntive and they told me can't open your account any more. I asked why it's suddenly happens and the reply was I did send fake docs and their was no transection that day on that wallet address.</p>
<p>I told them clearly they are checking my (BITCOIN CASH ) wallet address and please tell them to check my (BITCOIN)wallet address and tell them to check all the prof. Then I realized no reply from coustomer support and I email them 3times I got 1 reply your account was blocked my finance management. So I am really excited about my money and I am gonna attached all the proof which I have to this complaint.</p>
