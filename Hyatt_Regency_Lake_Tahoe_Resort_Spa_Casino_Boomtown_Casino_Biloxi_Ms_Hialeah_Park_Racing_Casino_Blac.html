    <h1>Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort Spa Casino Boomtown Casino Biloxi Ms Hialeah Park Racing Casino Blac</h1>

<p>I'm waiting for my 360 Euro withdrawal since 6th November 2023. I sucessfully verified my account in the past and was able to make a few withdrawals before but now they won't withdraw the rest of my winnings.</p>
<p>The casino told me that I need to verify my Powbet account and also should upload a transaction history from my bank statement. I did that but apparently this wasn't accepted, probably because I censored private information.</p>
<p>I therefor asked Powbet why my bank statement was not accepted because I believe it is my right to censor specific private information since it's none of Powbets business to know where I worked in the specific time frame or what my health insurance provider is or where I shopped. This is private information and shouldn't be relevant for Powbet. Especially because apparently they need this info to verify where my money came from, however I "just" deposited 100 Euros in the past and they verified and cashed out some of my winnings even without this information. That doesn't make sense to me...</p>
<p>I'm also wondering how they process this personal bank statement data. Does Powbet comply with the German "DSGVO" regulation to make sure my data is not misused?</p>
<p>After a while I received an answer by their support team stating that "[they] have forwarded the documentation request to the relevant department they will get back to [me] on email with reason as to why the document is not approved."</p>
<p>Almost 2 weeks have passed (in which my newly uploaded [partly censored] bank statement was rejected again) but I haven't received any reasoning from the relevant Powbet department!</p>
