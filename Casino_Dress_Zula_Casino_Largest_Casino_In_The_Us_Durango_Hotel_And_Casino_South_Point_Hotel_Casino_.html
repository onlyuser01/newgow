<p>New York sports betting launches at Tioga Downs Casino Resort</p>
<p>Four upstate locations allowed to offer sports betting in person</p>
<p>Senator Joseph Addabbo continues to demand online wagering</p>
<p>While Senator Addabbo is fighting for mobile wagering, New York launched sports betting official on Friday, July 19.</p>
<p>New York Launches Official Sports Betting</p>
<p>With New York sports betting already in progress, operators are hurrying up to bring their offer to the table and out-do the competition. This is precisely what happened on Friday, July 19, when Tioga Downs Casino Resort announced the official launch of its FanDuel Group-powered sports betting platform.</p>

<p>Based in Nichols, New York, the sports betting facility is now running a portfolio of sports betting options that will appeal to the majority of sports fans. The timing of the launch comes just after New York had legalized sports betting with the first wager placed on the same day by NY Assemblywoman Donna Lupardo.</p>
<p>Tiger Downs is one of four upstate casinos that will be accepting wagers on the outcome of sports events. During the ceremony, FanDuel VP Keith Wall said that the newly-launched sportsbook would offer a great economic return for the state. Here is what Wall had to add:</p>
<p>“As we continue to expand our sportsbook operations across the US the opening of our FanDuel Sportsbook at Tioga Downs Casino Resort is a history-making moment for the FanDuel Group”</p>
<p>Wall also expressed gratitude to Tioga Downs for accepting to launch FanDuel’s product in the state, as the company has been struggling to fend off its main competitor, DraftKings, elsewhere in the state. The new betting lounge offers 2,600 sq ft of betting grounds as well as 27 video displays and other perks, including 12 lounge seats, and 14 betting kiosks that sports betting aficionados can operate themselves.</p>
<p>Will Mobile Be Part of the Offer?</p>
<p>With mobile betting taking a back seat in the last legislative session, Senator Joseph Addabbo, a long-time friend of sports betting and online wagering, seems determined to restart dialogue once again. The senator has been unflagging in his zeal to create opportunities for online bettors to place wagers in New York.</p>
<p>Mr. Addabbo has been able to cite some pretty compelling data. New Jersey, he pointed out, caters to many New York bettors. In fact, 25% of all online wagers in the Garden State are placed by residents of New York.</p>
<p>NJ places it’s servers in Atlantic City for statewide mobile gaming to comply with its constitution, which we would do in NY with our licensed casinos to comply with our state constitution. — SenatorJoeAddabbo (@SenJoeAddabbo) June 19, 2019</p>
<p>Sen. Addabbo has been trying to get digital wagering kick-started in the Empire State for a fair while now, but the bill that eventually led to passing sports betting was stripped down of its mobile clause by Speaker Carl Heastie and Governor Andrew Cuomo who both have turned rather sceptical towards the segment.</p>
<p>Here is what Sen. Addabbo had to say against the common critics that New York hasn’t got enough people interested in betting online:</p>
<p>“One of the major detractions against sports betting here in New York is that there is no appetite for it”</p>
<p>He then continued by pointing out:</p>
<p>“This gaming market study proposed by the New York State Gaming Commission aims to find out exactly that. We can no longer sit on the sidelines and watch as money that could be coming to our state goes to New Jersey and surrounding states that allow mobile sports betting.”</p>
<p>The Senator appeared determined insofar as online wagering was concerned, arguing that the only way to ensure that New York uproots offshore sports betting is by introducing legalized digital wagering. This, Mr. Addabbo argued, was the only way to ensure that the state won it all.</p>
