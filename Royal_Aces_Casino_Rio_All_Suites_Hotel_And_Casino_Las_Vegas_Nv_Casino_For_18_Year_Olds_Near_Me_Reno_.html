<p>GAMSTOP, the UK’s leading online self-exclusion scheme, has continued to deliver sterling results in 2023, with March proving the single most successful month for the organizaiton which has been helping consumers stay in control of their gambling habits for years now, the program announced in a press release shared with Casino Guru News.</p>
<p>GAMSTOP reported 8,504 registrations in March alone, which is the highest number ever reported in a single month and also a 24% increase on March 2022’s registrations. This unprecedented number of self-exclusions come at a time when the United Kingdom is preparing to tighten the regulation of gambling laws in the country and introduce more consumer-protection measures.</p>
<p>The organizaiton launched its service back in April 2018, and it quickly raised to prominence, becoming a mandatory condition for all UK operators to have in order to operate in the market in March 2020. Five years after its launch, GAMSTOP has seen more than 365,000 people register with it, and 330,000 people remain excluded to this day, demonstrating the efficiency and dependency of the program.</p>
<p>GAMSTOP CEO Fiona Palmer hailed this milestone and said that the organizaiton has remained an important service in helping consumers protect themselves from excessive gambling and offering a reliable solution for vulnerable gamblers who want to take a break from gambling.</p>
<p>"The record monthly registrations shows that we cannot underestimate the demand for a scheme such as GAMSTOP. It is extremely important that we continue to raise awareness to make sure that anyone who needs us knows about us. We also need to continue to listen to our users and develop and improve the scheme to meet their needs," Palmer explained.</p>
<p>Part of the surge in self-exclusions was driven by the Cheltenham Festival, a horse racing event that took place on March 12-15, and is one of the most watched and bet sporting events in the country. The program has been known to offer reliable solutions to consumers, with 84% of participants reporting in a recent study by Sonnet, a research agency, that they felt safer because of having self-excluded with GAMSTOP.</p>
<p>GAMSTOP also offered insight from one of its registrants, Jack Scott (pictured) who hailed the life-changing impact the program had had on his life. He described a lengthy battle with his problem gambling and addiction that gradually come to an end after he self-excluded with GAMSTOP.</p>
<p>Scott confirmed that had it not been for the organizaiton, he would not have been able to tackle his problem. "I encourage anyone who thinks that they might be suffering from a gambling-related issue to research GAMSTOP," Scott said.</p>
