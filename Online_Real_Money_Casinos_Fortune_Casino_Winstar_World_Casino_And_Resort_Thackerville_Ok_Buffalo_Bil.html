<p>Emily Micallef has recently been appointed at the helm of SiGMA Group, one of the most influential gambling companies in the industry. Stepping into her position as Chief Executive Officer, we had the chance to catch up with Micallef and pick her brain about the future of the Group and her very appointment. SiGMA, says Micallef, is an equal-opportunity employer with a vision that is nothing short of revolutionary. Recapturing some of SiGMA’s successes and plotting a course for the future, Micallef’s interview is worth reading in its entirety.</p>
<p>Q: Emily, we would want to say that your recent appointment is remarkable, but we think that would be lessening your accomplishment that comes through your hard work and only that. So, we are going to stick to congrats! Yet, sitting at the top of SiGMA must be pretty exciting. What are your immediate plans for the organisation?</p>
<p>Our vision for the SiGMA Group is nothing short of revolutionary – we're on a mission to completely reshape the gambling landscape! Picture a world where the gambling industry thrives within a secure and responsible realm, all thanks to our groundbreaking single platform that unites education, regulation, innovation, and pure entertainment. This means businesses in the sector will not just survive but truly flourish in an ecosystem where gambling is fun, safe and sustainable.</p>
<p>My short-term goals include: consistently improving the quality of the SIGMA Group’s endeavours, solidifying our position in the 6 regions we operate within, and exploring new ones, and focusing on expanding the recruitment of top talent for our ever-growing team.</p>
<p>Q: We see a lot of powerful women leaders in the gambling industry. Jette Nygaard-Andersen, Denise Coates, yourself and others. Are you the exception, or are women upending the pecking order?</p>
<p>SiGMA is absolutely committed to being an equal-opportunity employer, and I'm thrilled to see incredible diversity across every level of our company. With offices spanning the globe, the SiGMA Group has been able to harness an abundance of talent, and in the exciting year of 2024, brimming with new events, upcoming deals, and acquisitions, there has never been a more fantastic moment to explore the incredible opportunities to become part of our dynamic Squad!</p>
<p>Q: How is SiGMA doing today and what do you see are areas of clear improvement? Has SiGMA been on par with industry events as a format, do you think, at a time when rival organisations are making monumental changes to their own organisational and calendar order?</p>
<p>SiGMA has grown from strength to strength - and industry events have grown likewise, with one supporting the other. The events industry is not about comparison - we must work together to redefine the industry ecosystem and push forward towards a well-regulated global landscape.</p>
<p>Q: SiGMA is already a global organisation, and there has been a lot of talk about global growth. What does this mean given the circumstances that you are already very well represented?</p>
<p>In recent years, our enthusiasm for expansion has been absolutely boundless, and it's been nothing short of exhilarating to watch our company's influence grow in leaps and bounds. Fast forward to the remarkable year of 2023, and we proudly introduced a lineup of new and incredibly successful events into our portfolio.</p>
<p>We started the year with SiGMA Africa, SiGMA Asia, and SiGMA Americas, held in the vibrant cities of Kenya, Manila, and Sao Paulo, respectively. And followed up with the breathtaking SiGMA Balkans and CIS event set against the stunning backdrop of Europe's first integrated resort, in Limassol. Additionally, we were thrilled to host SiGMA Curacao, with the esteemed presence of Curacao's Minister of Finance.</p>
<p>These events have gone far beyond just business opportunities and networking. They've become catalysts for pushing the boundaries of sustainable and regulated gaming in these regions, catapulting them to new heights within the industry.</p>
<p>Notably, Brazil and Dubai took significant strides towards achieving a regulated gaming landscape following their participation in SiGMA shows. Brazil implemented new legislation, while Dubai announced plans for a comprehensive regulatory framework for a national lottery and commercial gaming.</p>
<p>We've also just acquired our 5th affiliate licence, this time in Ohio, making us a licensed provider in the neighbouring states of New Jersey, Michigan, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Our commitment to conquering the North American market is unwavering, and this acquisition marks a monumental leap forward for SiGMA Play, our B2C affiliate portal.</p>
<p>Q: What is the next big thing we can expect from SiGMA that you can share with us?</p>
<p>Delegates can expect a continuous stream of exciting developments from us in the years ahead, including the announcement of new events and strategic acquisitions in the coming months. Stay tuned - next year is going to be worth the wait!</p>
