<p>Leo Margets won her first WSOP bracelet last week. She won the $1,500 The Closer tournament that granted her the bracelet as well as a hefty $370,000 prize.</p>
<p>Leo Margets Takes Home First WSOP Bracelet</p>
<p>Last week was a successful week for the Spanish players participating in the WSOP. After Adrian Mateos won his fourth WSOP bracelet by becoming the winner of the $250,000 Super High Roller on Saturday, Leo Margets won her first WSOP bracelet the next day.</p>
<p>Margets won the WSOP Event #83: $1,500 The Closer tournament. That tournament brought her a $376,850 prize as well as a WSOP bracelet. As the winner of the tournament, she is one of the two ladies this year that have won a bracelet. It was back in October when Lara Eisenberg won her first WSOP bracelet for taking first place in WSOPâ€™s Event #22: Ladies Championship.</p>
<p>Overall, $1,500 The Closer tournament attracted a field of 1,900 entries. Considering the $1,500 buy-in, the prize pool that was generated hit $2.5 million. However, according to WSOP, only the first 274 players received a prize and only the top four were in for a six-figure payout.</p>
<p>Leo Margets takes down The Closer and becomes the first female of this year's series to win an open bracelet event. The Spain native earns $376,850 for the momentous victory.</p>

<p>Margetsâ€™ Win May Motivate More Women to Play Poker</p>
<p>To win the tournament, Margets had to go through a field of seasoned poker pros and none of them was ready to give up without a fight. Some of her adversaries included Joao Simao and Alex Kulev, as well as Michael Wang and Chris Moorman. With that in mind, the UK pro Moorman did get into the top 10, but took eighth place and went home with some $44,470 prize. The seventh player to hit the rail was Aleksandr Shevliakov. The player from Russia took home a $57,525 prize and was followed by Cherish Andrews that took sixth place. Andrews collected a $74,680 prize.</p>
<p>Arturo Segura was the player that took fifth place. He received a $97,865 prize and was followed by Marc Lange from Germany. Lange took fourth place and got home with some $129,460. US player Stephen Song was eliminated next and he took third place. His prize was $172,855.</p>
<p>In the end, the heads-up battle was between Alex Kulev and Margets. The Bosnian pro Kulev had an incredible chip lead, but in the end, he was eliminated by Margets. By taking second, he went home with $376,850.</p>
<p>Margets spoke to Pokernews recently and revealed that it is much harder for a woman to win a WSOP bracelet. She acknowledged that a prime reason is because there are few women playing poker. According to Margets, her win may help motivate more women interested in poker. Counting her most recent win, according to the Hendon Mob, by now, Margets has earned some $1.6 million from poker tournaments.</p>
