    <h1>New Casino In Virginia Casinos Arizona Laughlin Casinos Ace Casino Casino For Real Money Thebes Casi</h1>

<p>Dear Aleh2684,</p>
<p>I was provided with sufficient evidence supporting the casino's claims and decision. Unfortunately, after gathering all the necessary information we are closing this complaint as unjustified due to breaching the casino's bonus terms and conditions - multiple free bonuses were claimed consecutively without making a valid deposit of the minimum amount, thus exceeding a ratio of No Deposit Bonuses to valid deposits. At least 4 No Deposit Bonuses were claimed and used before the first valid deposit (amount over $10) was made. Moreover, all winnings were obtained from the bonuses used before this first valid deposit. You are not entitled to any winnings obtained from these bonuses. The casino acted within its terms and conditions.</p>
<p>It is the players' obligation to read the terms and conditions before accepting them. Moreover, we are talking about bonuses and free money. The casinos can limit this free money as they see fit unless it is not against our Fair Gambling Codex. The ideal case would be if the casinos enforce their rules by software. But, currently, it is not an industry standard and therefore, we are able to accept it. In addition, it makes sense that any casino will not give its players only free money until they win or make a deposit of a minimum amount.</p>
<p>Sorry, we were not able to help you with this one, but please, do not hesitate to contact us in the future, if you run into any issues with this or any other casino. We are here to help.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the complaint solution, I recommend you consult the gambling authority that the casino is regulated by. In case of any questions, feel free to write to me at branislav.b@casino.guru.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Thebes Casino Team, for providing information and for your cooperation.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Branislav, Casino.Guru</p>
