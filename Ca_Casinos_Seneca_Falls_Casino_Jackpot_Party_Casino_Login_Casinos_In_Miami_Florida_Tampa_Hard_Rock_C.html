    <h1>Ca Casinos Seneca Falls Casino Jackpot Party Casino Login Casinos In Miami Florida Tampa Hard Rock C</h1>

<p>Hello ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>the problem is as follows.</p>
<p>I still had exactly €55.00 in credit. I went into a game where the maximum bet is €10.00 .</p>
<p>I played the game for 40 cents. After a while I just wanted to lower the stakes to 20 cents. Then something happened that doesn't work at all and has never happened to me before. My friend also saw it with his own eyes. When I wanted to switch to 20 cents, it changed to a whopping €31.00 for inexplicable reasons and turned once by itself. My friend and I looked at our balance and saw that we now only have €21.00 . But how can that only be possible when the maximum bet is only €10.00 . This is clear rip-off and fraud. Adding to that, I've read up a bit and it seems I'm not the only one who felt this way. Apparently the owner can afford to get such a rating. I would like my message to be taken seriously and I await a solution to this issue as well.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Marie-Therese G***</p>
