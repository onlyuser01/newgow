<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. Buffalo Bills is the Thursday Night Football (TNF) game of Week 8. It’s taking place at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, New York on October 26, 2023</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills lost two of their last three games, but neither of those losses happened at Highmark Stadium. On their turf, Bills Mafia is 3-0 in 2023, with their most impressive performance being the one against the Miami Dolphins, which saw them win 48-20. This Thursday, they’re welcoming another team from Florida, should we expect to see the same scenario play out?</p>

<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers Just Hoping to Avoid Embarrassment</p>
<p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are 3-3 in the 2023 season, with two straight losses after a bye in Week 5. They lost to the Detroit Lions 20-6 and the Atlanta Falcons 16-13, each time at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.</p>
<p>Obviously, there’s something wrong with their offense when they failed to score more than 20 points in total in their last two home games. Actually, their season average is 17.2, which is one of the worst numbers in the league. In comparison, the Bills are averaging 28.3 points per game.</p>

<p>So, what’s the reason behind Tampa’s poor offensive display? Well, none of the Bucs’ offensive players have been great in 2023, with quarterback Baker Mayfield just failing to connect his passes enough times. So far, he’s thrown for eight touchdowns, but only one of those happened in the last two games.</p>
<p>To make things even worse, he picked up a knee injury last weekend. According to the man himself, he’ll be ready for the TNF game against the Bills, but he won’t be at 100% fitness.</p>
<p>Buffalo Bills Wanna Bounce Back in Style</p>
<p>The Bills are coming off a surprising 29-25 loss to the New England Patriots in Foxborough last weekend. Before that game, the Pats were one of the worst offenses in the league, while the Bills had some of the best defensive numbers.</p>
<p>They still have impressive defensive stats, with just 16.85 points conceded per game on average. That number is even more impressive when it comes to the games they’ve played at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park.</p>
<p>On their turf, they’ve played three games this season, winning each of those. They scored a total of 100 points in those three games, while conceding just 39. That’s just 13 points conceded on average at Highmark Stadium in the 2023 NFL season.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. Buffalo Bills Prediction</p>
<p>The Bills are guaranteed to keep the Buccaneers to a very low number of points. It’s not only because Buffalo’s defense is elite but also because the Bucs QB is struggling with a knee injury. When it comes to the Bills offense, Josh Allen &amp; Co. should be able to score somewhere near their season average (~28).</p>
<p>Picks: Buffalo Bills to win and cover the spread; under to hit</p>
