    <h1>Seven Feathers Casino Oregon J7Bet Casino Casino Ocean City Casino Royale Hotel Sweepstakes Casino R</h1>

<p>Both teams have already booked the ticket to the postseason, but this doesn’t mean they got nothing left to fight for. On the contrary, these two are competing for the no. 1 seed in the AFC. And even if that wasn’t the case, the sheer amount of talent these teams have on the roster would still make the Bills vs Bengals game a real spectacle.</p>

<p>The Bills Eying the No.1 Seed</p>
<p>The Buffalo Bills are 6-0 since Week 10 when they lost 33-30 after overtime to the Minnesota Vikings. They’re averaging 28 points per game while allowing just 17.5. This makes their offense the fourth-best in the league, while their defense is second.</p>
<p>The most impressive thing about the Bills is that they tend to show up in big games. This season, we saw them beat the Miami Dolphins (twice), Kansas City Chiefs, and a few other heavyweights.</p>
<p>In their most recent game, they routinely beat the Chicago Bears. The Bills came to Chicago as 10-point favorites and ended up winning 35-13. Their quarterback Josh Allen had an okay game, going 16/26 for 172 yards and two touchdowns, but he also got two of his passes intercepted. That’s kind of strange because his passing stats in 2022 are fantastic.</p>
<p>Still, his performance didn’t cause problems for the Bills, whose running game was brilliant that day. Allen himself scored one rushing touchdown, with two running backs – Devin Singletary and James Cook – scoring a TD each as well.</p>
<p>The Bengals are In Top Shape Right Now</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be an overstatement to call the Cincinnati Bengals the most impressive team in the NFL right now. They’re 7-0 since October with some really impressive wins. They didn’t blow out anyone, but they did beat some really tough opponents, including the Kansas City Chiefs, Cleveland Browns, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and New England Patriots.</p>
<p>They’re averaging 26.1 points per game, with their defense conceding 20.4 points on average. Those numbers might not be too great, but they seem to be working out for them. The question is how long can their run last?</p>
<p>Buffalo Bills vs Cincinnati Bengals Prediction</p>
<p>Although there’s not much difference between these two, we do think the Bills are better than the Bengals. That said, we think the visitors are going to win the Week 17 MNF game, but probably by no more than just a field goal.</p>
<p>Pick: Buffalo Bills to win</p>
