<p>The Mega Millions jackpot for tomorrow night’s draw is an estimated $530 million, the lottery game’s eighth-largest prize in its more than quarter-century history.</p>

<p>No ticket has matched all five white balls and the gold Mega Ball since April 15, when a player in Tennessee won a $20 million prize. Last Friday’s winning numbers were 8-20-26-53-64 and the Mega Ball 15.</p>
<p>During Friday’s draw, mega Millions told Casino.org that 1,423,423 tickets won some sort of prize, from $2 to $1 million.</p>
<p>The top prize came by way of California, where a single ticket matched all five white balls to win the game’s top non-jackpot prize of $1 million. But unfortunately for that player, the California Lottery does not participate in the Mega Millions $1 add-on Megaplier option. The Megaplier is randomly drawn during the game’s Tuesday and Friday draws.</p>
<p>The Megaplier can double, triple, quadruple, or even quintuple a prize. Last Friday’s Megaplier draw hit the 5x multiplier, which would have ballooned the California individual’s prize to $5 million.</p>
<p>Megaplier Odds 2x: 1 in 3 3x: 1 in 2.5 4x: 1 in 5 5x: 1 in 15</p>
<p>With no ticket matching all six numbers, the Mega Millions jackpot rolls over for the Tuesday, July 19, draw.</p>
<p>History Coming</p>
<p>Mega Millions tomorrow night could forever change someone’s life. The estimated $530 million jackpot is the game’s biggest prize since January 2021, when a winning ticket worth more than $1 billion was sold in Michigan.</p>
<p>$1.537B 10/23/2018 — 1-SC $1.05B 1/22/2021 — 1-MI $656M 3/30/2012 — 3-IL, KS, MD $648M 12/17/2013 — 2-CA, GA $543M 7/24/2018 — 1-CA $536M 7/8/2016 — 1-IN $533M 3/30/2018 — 1-NJ $530M (est.) 7/19/2022 — ? $522M 6/7/2019 — 1-CA $516M 5/21/2021 — 1-PA</p>
<p>The January 2021 10-figure win was claimed by a “lottery club” in Oakland County, Mi. Calling themselves the Wolverine FLL Club, the four-person group purchased the winning $1.05 billion ticket at a Kroger grocery store in Novi.</p>
<p>The group said they “plan to stay humble” and “pay it forward through charitable giving in southeast Michigan.” It was a generous jackpot, as the Kroger that sold the ticket donated its $50,000 bonus commission for selling the ticket to the Food Bank Council of Michigan.</p>
<p>Lucky July</p>
<p>Though the odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are a measly one in 302.6 million — even worse than Powerball’s jackpot odds of one in 292.2 million –, July has historically been a good month for historic Mega Millions jackpot wins.</p>
<p>Two of the largest Mega Millions jackpots in the game’s history were won in July. A $536 million Mega Millions win was hit on July 8, 2016, and a $543 million prize was won on July 24, 2018.</p>
<p>Since the April 15 jackpot, Mega Millions says more than 15.5 million prize-winning tickets have been sold, including 25 worth $1 million or more.</p>
<p>The Mega Millions jackpot has been hit only four times in 2022. The others came on January 28 with a $426 million prize, March 8 with a $128 million win, and April 12 with a $110 million reward.</p>
