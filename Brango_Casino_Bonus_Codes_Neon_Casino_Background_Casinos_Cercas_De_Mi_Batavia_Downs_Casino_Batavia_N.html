<p>The Dana White’s Contender Series wasn’t immediately welcomed but seven weeks of successful high-class MMA has earned the format its good name and reputation. Now, we are heading into the Contender Series Week 8 on Tuesday and with this, we are keen to explore the numerous fighters who will try to earn a place in the UFC.</p>
<p>Valesca Machado, Solomon Renfro, James Barnes, and numerous others are looking into making it to the UFC where the pay is much better and so are the challenges that fighters face. With 28 contracts already successfully signed in the series, the main fight between Renfro and Parsons is bound to produce a winner who will be promoted to the UFC at once.</p>

<p>Where and When to Watch Contender Series (Week 8)</p>
<p>Date : Tuesday, October 19</p>
<p>: Tuesday, October 19 Time : 8:00 pm ET</p>
<p>: 8:00 pm ET Venue : UFC Apex, Las Vegas, Nevada</p>
<p>: UFC Apex, Las Vegas, Nevada Watch: ESPN</p>
<p>Fighting for a Spot in the UFC: Renfro vs Parsons</p>
<p>The odds have Renfro and Parsons almost neck and neck with (-150) versus (+130). Both fighters have a good track record and they are also very closely matched which will make the main fight in the series interesting.</p>
<p>Renfro though is leading the way with 8-1 in his overall track record in the CFFC, which is one of the top regional promotions in the United States and he is no doubt posted as the favorite in this clash. He has been able to complete several high-profile fights, disposing of Mike Malott who was recently admitted to the UFC.</p>
<p>Already proving himself once, Renfro is tipped to win this one as well in the UFC Apex bout tomorrow, but Parsons will also be looking to have a say in the matter. Jonny is the underdog here with (+130) on the moneyline and an overall 7-2 track record. He competes in a lower promotion, too, with the iKon Fighting Federation attracting alright fighters through and through.</p>
<p>So, where are Parsons’ strengths really? He has been able to do a lot in his fighting bouts, combining powerful punches with building up enough stamina to last the distance or submit an opponent. Parsons is a bit of a wildcard as he can do well but he can do worse as well. His track record is good and he’s also riding a four-fight winning streak so far.</p>
<p>The odds don’t support a bet on Parsons here and risking on him might be not worth it. We would argue to lean in a little heavier on Renfro here and back him up on the moneyline.</p>
<p>Tale of the Tape: Renfro vs Parsons</p>
<p>Solomon Renfro Vs. Jonny Parsons 24 Age 30 5’9″ Height 5’10” 165.2 lbs Weight 175 lbs N/A Reach 69.0″ 8-1 Record 7-2</p>
<p>The bout between Renfro and Parsons puts two fighters who share almost the same physical attributes. Parsons does have a few pounds on Renfro but Renfro’s reach is not subject to record. Renfro is also younger which a plus is always and he seems to be more successful in the overall standing. He is also fighting in a higher class division.</p>
<p>Rest of the Contender Series Week 8</p>
<p>The remainder of the event will also have some interesting fights to consider. We have offered a brief breakdown of each and the expected winner. For the bout between Piera Rodriguez and Machado, we definitely see Rodriguez deliver an early TKO/KO and win the fight.</p>
<p>Kaloyan Kolev may not have made much of an impression in the fight world but he is posted at (-300) and he will be bringing a UFC contract home. Caio Borralho is a great technical fighter and the (-380) odds are fair as he will be able to prevail over Murray. As to the final fight between James Barnes and Pedro Falcao, we see Barnes as the deserving underdog and will back him on his (+165).</p>
