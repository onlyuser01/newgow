    <h1>Ripper Casino Casino In Phoenix Az Oceans 11 Casino Hard Rock Casino In Tampa Casino Palace Station</h1>

<p>First I play at extreme and it’s sister sites a lot. I rarely win enough to cash out but I have withdrawn small amounts at extreme with no problem. I was very surprised when I won over 3000.00. I was playing with a no rules bonus and I had met the bonus requirements so I went to cash out. For the first time ever I was prevented from withdrawing for kyc. I immediately sent them the documents. I emailed asking how long it would take and asked to make the withdrawal. I was not able to even request a withdrawal pending approval. They responded it could take several days.. So I continued to play. I am very careful to never bet more than 5.00 a spin and I had met the bonus terms so didn’t worry.</p>
<p>The last game I played was 777, I had never played it before. I bet 2.50 per spin. But I held part of the spin a few times not realizing this was considered a bet.</p>
<p>It was at the end of playing this game that I sent an email explaining I had never had to wait before and I felt like this was a stalling tactic. And almost immediately I received a response that they had lifted the kyc and I could request a deposit. I was happy and relieved because I like these casinos and I did not like to think they were trying to not honor the payout. I sent them a response telling them how thankful I was that they were the good faith casino I thought they were.</p>
<p>i am now pretty sure they only allowed me to request the withdrawal because I had finally given them a reason to deny it.</p>
<p>I do not feel like I breached the terms and conditions that says bonuses have a 10.00 wager cap. I had met all the requirements of the bonus and the cap should no longer apply. This game had nothing to do with my winnings or the bonus. Even if they think I broke the terms keeping everything I won just because they can and just because they know I have no recourse is bad business and bad practice. And I wasn’t the only one that broke the terms of our agreement, I play there because they guarantee fast payouts, if they hadn’t breached there terms I wouldn’t have unknowingly breached mine.</p>
<p>I will send the emails if you need them. I sent the id documents to them at 330pm asking to be allowed to make a withdrawal. The overbets occurred from 1124pm to 1136pm. The block on withdrawals was lifted at 11:59 pm. They waited until I made an unintentional and unknown mistake and used it as a reason to take all my winnings.</p>
