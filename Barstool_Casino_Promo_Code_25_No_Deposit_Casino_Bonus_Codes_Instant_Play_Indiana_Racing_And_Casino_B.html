<p>https://www.jackspay.com/tips-and-info/about-our-bonuses/</p>
<p>It states.</p>
<p>" Jack loves giving out bonuses to keep the action going.</p>
<p>Jack will take it from here</p>
<p>Terms and Condition for a bonus</p>
<p>Bonuses for the most part come with wagering requirements, meaning after</p>
<p>you claim a bonus you will have to wager a predefined amount of bets.</p>
<p>Claiming bonuses with the sole intention of withdrawing will not be</p>
<p>tolerated and will void winnings.</p>
<p>This includes;</p>
<p>Redeeming bonus and 'just' covering the wagering requirements to</p>
<p>withdraw.</p>
<p>Building up visible jackpots with bonus money &amp; returning later without</p>
<p>bonus to exploit the built up bonus money free spins</p>
<p>Jack knows all tricks and he's not going to let it happen.</p>
<p>Remember; bonuses are for entertainment - abuse is not going to be</p>
<p>tolerated</p>
<p>If you're looking to bonus hunt, Jack suggests to go elsewhere "</p>
<p>You agreed to these terms. Jackspay has the right to void your winnings</p>
<p>and suspend your account at any time.</p>
<p>We didn't suspend your account because you have a withdrawal or because</p>
<p>we are trying to take away a players winnings.</p>
<p>You signed up legally.</p>
<p>You automatically agreed to our terms as a player.</p>
<p>The last few weeks you showed that your intentions are to withdrawal as</p>
<p>you meet hence a conversation you had with our agent where you kept</p>
<p>coming into chat.</p>
<p>You kept saying increase my withdrawal limit.</p>
<p>Finally met wagering right on the dot. Your intention was to withdrawal.</p>
<p>If it wasn't, you would have kept betting and you wouldn't have asked to</p>
<p>withdrawal and followed our terms which then would be no issue.</p>
<p>Yes, you are a depositing player but over 100 times you would ask for</p>
<p>more bonuses over and over again.</p>
<p>Again your intentions were to get freebies/ bonuses to run your balance,</p>
<p>barely meet wagering and then withdrawal.</p>
<p>You even had a conversation with Taylor L where he said sorry we cannot</p>
<p>give you bonuses as we bonus based on wagering and you said well if your</p>
<p>not going to bonus me the way i want, i will just leave.</p>
<p>Which you did..</p>
<p>You came back again. You were given bonuses, you won, then all of a</p>
<p>sudden.</p>
<p>Barely meet wagering requirements again.</p>
<p>So, as a casino, we had to determine whether having you as an active</p>
<p>player whose intention is to use our bonuses to withdrawal which is</p>
<p>against our terms and conditions</p>
<p>Do we just allow this sort of behaviour or do we as a casino look into</p>
<p>this as a case where bonus abuse is apparent.</p>
<p>You agreed to our terms, you broke them several times and ran up your</p>
<p>balance and used chip bonuses with money you won after barely meeting.</p>
<p>We cannot tolerate that sort of behaviour.</p>
<p>We as a casino have decided to suspend your account and void your</p>
<p>winnings which we do based on reviewing your account from a professional</p>
<p>perspective.</p>
<p>We have screenshots showing that this isnt some made up attempt.</p>
<p>We are sorry that you had to wait for us to conclude a review.</p>
<p>I have been doing this for 20 + years.</p>
<p>You didn't get suspended for 0 reason.</p>
<p>Your actions caused our actions of suspension.</p>
<p>We are sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>Our intentions are not to block people.</p>
<p>But as a business we must follow all rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>
<p>Jacks people</p>
