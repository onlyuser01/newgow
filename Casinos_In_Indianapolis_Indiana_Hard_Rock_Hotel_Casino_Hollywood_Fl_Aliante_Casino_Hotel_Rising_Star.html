    <h1>Casinos In Indianapolis Indiana Hard Rock Hotel Casino Hollywood Fl Aliante Casino Hotel Rising Star</h1>

<p>The supplier of leading live casino gaming content has extended its partnership with Pronet Gaming, an established betting and gaming platform</p>
<p>As a result, LuckyStreak will be offering its extensive library of games to Pronet Gaming, and further strengthen the latter’s content library and position as a player-favorite operator. The deployment of new content will be facilitated by Playson and the LuckyConnect aggregation API, significantly scaling the available products in the live casino, but also slot verticals for Pronet Gaming.</p>
<p>The Three Partners Deliver Outstanding Experiences to Players</p>
<p>LuckyStreak head of account management Virginia Russu welcomed the opportunity to continue working with Pronet Gaming. LuckyStreak and the operator have been together since 2015. Commenting on this extended alliance, Russu said:</p>
<p>I’m delighted that we can now offer them Playson’s rich library of innovative and fun slot and table games, which will enrich their customers’ offerings significantly. LuckyStreak head of account management Virginia Russu</p>
<p>Russu further commended the fact that LuckyConnect made the process smooth by making sure that integration happens flawlessly for the partners and that no additional technical prerequires are required.</p>
<p>Pronet Gaming CEO Alex Leese was similarly excited to have the opportunity and see the two partners continue to collaborate together. Leese said that he was happy to further enhance the library of games available to players.</p>
<p>“The addition of Playson’s titles to our platform further builds on the expansive range of content we offer our partners and adds a name that customers can trust,” Leese added. Playson’s CCO, Tamas Kusztos, also joined the conversation and added that the company was very pleased to team up with LuckyConnect and make it even easier to distribute games from its own studios and third parties.</p>
<p>LuckyStreak Leads the Way for Live Casino Aggregators</p>
<p>This new partnership with Pronet has already led to a significant upswing in volume as well, and the potential is definitely there for even better results. LuckyStreak is an established casino that focuses on live casino gaming, but the tie-up with Playson and Pronet Gaming now allows the company to deliver even more experiences, such as slot. What is unique here is that LuckyConnect is an aggregator that is specifically dedicated to live casino games.</p>
