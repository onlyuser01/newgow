<p>Leading online slots supplier Play’n GO will bring its selection of acclaimed titles to UK fans after an agreement with Kindred-owned brand 32Red</p>
<p>The partnership marks another cornerstone achievement in Play’n GO’s international expansion efforts. The developer gathered substantial momentum in 2022 and strengthening its position in another critical market marks a great start to the new year. Play’n GO and Kindred expand on a long history of successful cooperation, expressing their intention to retain their close ties in the future.</p>
<p>The Developer Starts the Year in a Stellar Position</p>
<p>Play’n GO is riding in the wake of an immensely successful 2022. The Sweden-based slot developer shared its vision to become “the best gaming entertainment supplier there is” and is actively working towards that goal. Play’n GO’s distinct style grabbed the attention of many operators, aiding the developer’s ambitious expansion efforts and opening the way into several new jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Last year saw the company release new titles almost monthly, significantly expanding its acclaimed portfolio. The consistent release schedule helped Play’n GO to prove its merits and conclude several high-profile partnerships. The company strengthened its position in core European markets like Italy and enjoyed stellar progress overseas, reaching a significant milestone in North America.</p>
<p>July marked the developer’s first entry into the US market as it received a B2B license in Michigan, followed by a successful launch in New Jersey with BetMGM. The breakthrough marked the culmination of Play’n GO’s growth ambitions, making 2022 an extremely successful year. However, the company still maintains considerable momentum and has scored another high-profile victory.</p>
<p>The UK Remains a Vital Strategic Market</p>
<p>A deal with Kindred-owned brand 32Red extends Play’n GO’s reach in the coveted UK market. The two companies have a rich history of cooperation in Europe, laying the groundwork for this most recent agreement. Play’n GO UK regional director Anna Mackney expressed excitement to work with a leading operator, pledging to deliver the company’s signature quality products.</p>

<p>32Red fans will be able to enjoy the developer’s flagship games like Book of Dead and region-tailored titles like MegaDon, Boat Bonanza, and Shamrock Miner. Play’n GO is active in more than 25 regulated jurisdictions, providing the necessary experience to ensure a smooth launch. 32Red commercial operations manager Adam Newnham shared that sentiment, expressing faith in Play’n GO’s history of success.</p>
<p>With an exciting pipeline of content lined up for the coming months, we’re looking forward to providing more of the best Play’n GO content to 32Red’s customers. Adam Newnham, 32Red commercial operations manager</p>
<p>As Play’n GO kicks off 2023 with a bang, it rides on a series of high-profile victories. However, the uncertain global economic situation and rising inflation may hamper the company’s ambitions. Even so, Play’n GO has largely cemented its place as a leading worldwide developer and will likely continue to ride its wave of success for some time.</p>
