<p>Rosie’s Gaming will open its new venue in Dumfries, Virginia early next month. The venue will feature 150 Historical Horse Racing slot machines. Initially, some slots may be disabled due to social distancing protocols in light of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Rosie’s Gaming Opens New Venue in Dumfries Next Month</p>
<p>A new Rosie’s Gaming venue is expected to open doors in Dumfries, Virginia early next month. The venue, located in southern Prince William County will feature 150 Historical Horse Racing (HHR) electronic gaming devices. Although the machines may look similar to any other slot machine, they are, in fact, different.</p>
<p>Whenever a player places a wager on one of the machines, the outcome is related to horse races that have already passed. In other words, the outcome of the wagers placed on the HHR machines, also known as “horse slots”, relies on information from the past related to odds and other horse race features. With that in mind, although Rosie’s Gaming new location will have 150 machines, some of them might be powered off so that the venue can comply with the distancing protocols, introduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Speaking for the Associated Press, the general manager at Rosie’s new location in Dumfries, Rick Casagrande, revealed that people are looking for an “entertainment option that’s clean, safe and friendly” and that Rosie’s is going to deliver exactly what is needed. According to him, it is expected that the new venue will quickly gain popularity.</p>
<p>Rosie’s New Venue to Help City’s Economy, Creates New Workplaces</p>
<p>Casagrande’s expectations may be met quite soon once the new venue opens in early January. This is because the operator has already placed such slot machines in Hampton, Vinton, Richmond, and Colonial Downs. In fact, those machines proved to be a big success for the company hitting $170 million in wagers and $155 million in winnings last month.</p>
<p>Although some Virginians choose to flee to Hollywood Casino at Charles Town racetrack in West Virginia or to visit MGM’s National Harbor in Maryland, Rosie’s new venue at Dumfries will undoubtedly catch the attention of many northern Virginia residents.</p>
<p>According to Derrick Wood, Dumfries’ Mayor, Rosie’s new venue is a significant investment. There will be more than 100 people who are going to be hired to work at the venue. Community groups may also receive support from the company, revealed Wood. Besides the workplaces that are going to be created in the city, based on early projections, Rosie’s new venue may even increase Dumfries’ revenue by some 20%.</p>
