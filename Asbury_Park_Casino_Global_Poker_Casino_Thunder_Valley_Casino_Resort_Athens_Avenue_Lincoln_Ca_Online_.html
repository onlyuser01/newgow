<p>Mungham will remain with the company until a suitable successor has been found, the outgoing CEO promised</p>
<p>The Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) announced that Tom Mungham, its current registrar and chief executive officer, has decided to retire from his current roles this fall. The regulator will now look out for a suitable replacement with the help of an executive search firm.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Mungham will continue serving as registrar and CEO until his successor has been appointed. Even then, he will remain with the company for a while longer to ensure a smooth transition of power.</p>
<p>Mungham Contributed a Lot to the AGCO</p>
<p>Mungham has worked in the public service sector for the past 33 years. Prior to his tenure at the AGCO, the man worked in the Ministries of Correctional Services and Solicitor General. He was later admitted into the Ontario Provincial Police, which he served in many capacities. Thanks to his hard work, Mungham was appointed honorary superintendent in 2016.</p>
<p>The public service veteran joined the Ontarian gambling regulator in 2006. At first, he served as its director of licensing and registration before being promoted to chief operating officer. In 2020, Mungham was finally named the authority’s registrar and CEO.</p>
<p>During his time at the AGCO, Mungham was an exemplary leader who helped the regulator with many regulatory modernization initiatives. He was instrumental in many such initiatives such as the modernization and expansion of land-based casinos, the regulation of OLG lotteries, the expansion of charity gambling and the merger of the Ontario Racing Commission and the AGCO. He also played a role in the introduction of beer, wine and cider sales in grocery stores and the introduction of Ontario’s private cannabis retail framework.</p>
<p>The AGCO Team Thanked Mungham for His Exceptional Work</p>
<p>Mungham’s latest endeavor was overseeing the launch and regulation of Ontario’s fresh iGaming market. The Canadian province launched online gaming last year. Thanks to Mungham and the AGCO’s hard work, the Ontarian regulated framework received the International Association of Gaming Regulators’ Regulatory Excellence Award in 2022.</p>
<p>Mungham supported the regulator’s diversity, inclusion and accessibility efforts, thanks to which the AGCO is currently implementing a long-term DI&amp;A strategy.</p>
<p>Lalit Aggarwal, the AGCO’s chair, thanked Mungham for his “tremendous contributions” to the AGCO. Aggarwal praised the outgoing CEO’s exceptional qualities as a leader and wished him all the best.</p>
<p>We extend him our deepest appreciation for his guidance in fulfilling AGCO’s mandate with unwavering commitment to the values of integrity, respect, accountability, and public interest. We wish him the very best for this next, well-earned chapter. Lalit Aggarwal, chair, AGCO</p>
