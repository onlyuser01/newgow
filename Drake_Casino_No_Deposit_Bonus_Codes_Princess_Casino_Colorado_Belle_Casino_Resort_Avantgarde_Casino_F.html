<p>The company’s continued investments in North America proved successful, as the region significantly contributed to its impressive revenue</p>
<p>Global gaming solution provider Aristocrat Leisure has reported positive financial results for the first half (H1). The company’s focus on diversifying its portfolio through strategic acquisitions is already paying dividends, ensuring fiscal stability despite macroeconomic pressures. North American operations performed exceedingly well, justifying further investments in the region.</p>
<p>Revenue Growth Retains Its Momentum</p>
<p>Aristocrat’s H1 2023 earnings call showcased a robust performance across most verticals as the company delivered solid financial growth. In the six-month period ending 31 March, revenues reached $3.08 billion, a 12.2% increase compared to last year. EBITDA also fared well, rising 5.7% to $1.03 billion, showcasing the company’s solid foundations.</p>
<p>Pre-tax profits soared by 42.6%, reaching $852.8 million. Even the post-tax figure of $653 million was impressive, giving Aristocrat substantial leeway to pursue further growth opportunities through strategic investments. Overall, the company continues to ride its 2022 momentum, accelerating in its core markets and setting the stage for new partnerships and continued expansion.</p>
<p>The USA Emerged as a Leading Market</p>
<p>Aristocrat Leisure’s North American operations have been a key growth driver, capitalizing on increased consumer spending and a resurgence in demand for gaming products and services. Frequent high-profile partnerships helped the company establish a presence in over 55% of the US iGaming market. Aristocrat hopes to raise that figure to at least 70% within five years, solidifying its leadership position.</p>
<p>Anaxi, the company’s real money gaming (RMG) division, performed spectacularly well, more than justifying 2022’s $42 million invested in its operations. Its collaborations with leading operators like Caesars and FanDuel were a testament to the quality of its content. Aristocrat CEO and managing director Trevor Croker highlighted the importance of the online segment and Anaxi’s vital contributions to the group.</p>
<p>Our newest operating business, Anaxi, delivered on its initial market entry commitments and established sound foundations for growth. Trevor Croker, Aristocrat CEO, and managing director</p>
<p>The impressive H1 financials should allow Aristocrat to pursue additional growth opportunities. The group recently announced its proposed acquisition of iGaming and iLottery solution provider NeoGames. If successful, the deal will significantly expand Aristocrat’s global reach and bolster the company’s RMG ambitions. Such strategic investments are vital to Aristocrat’s long-term performance and ability to remain competitive in the saturated supplier market.</p>
<p>The benefit of our investment to grow and diversify Aristocrat’s revenue base was particularly evident in our ability to deliver solid revenue growth and stable EBITDA… Trevor Croker, Aristocrat CEO, and managing director</p>
<p>The 26.4% rise in Aristocrat’s US segment contrasts the relative stagnation in its Australia and Pixel United divisions and will shape its ongoing strategy. With a strong track record and a commitment to continuous improvement, Aristocrat Leisure is well-positioned to capitalize on future opportunities and thrive in a dynamic market environment.</p>
