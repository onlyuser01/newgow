<p>Gambling Laboratories International has awarded its certification to Bingo Treasures, a new product developed by Video King and Parlay Games, which styles itself as a “tribally linked” experience. The companies teased the rollout of the product a while back, telling consumers that they are working on a Class II Bingo Game that will feature a millions-worth prize pool every week.</p>
<p>Creating a Tribal Linked Bingo Game</p>
<p>To make sure they can realize this ambitious project, the companies have brought together their assets and development acumen as part of a new joint venture. The GLI certification is proof that the hard work behind the companies’ products has paid off. Bingo Treasures has already been protected under copyright law by the US Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
<p>Bingo Treasures will be licensed exclusively to tribal gaming operators and Video King has already begun the process of securing partners. Video King chief financial officer Rusty Morin commented on these developments and said:</p>
<p>“With the GLI approval in hand, we will now be working quickly to finalize license agreements and installation dates with tribes who will be first movers with us and who will launch Bingo Treasures at any facility on their tribal lands.” Video King chief financial officer Rusty Morin</p>
<p>Thanks to the unique combination of the Class II bingo software certification and the patented technologies, the companies are able to provide consumers at US Sovereign National Indian Tribes with unique gameplay. Morin is confident that the game will become a national phenomenon and feature billion worth of prizes.</p>
<p>Weekly Draws Anything Between $2M and $100M</p>
<p>Explaining the soft and hard cap of the weekly draws, Morin specified that the game has been adjusted to feature jackpots between $2 million and $100 million. Customer engagement in the bingo sector is already strong, says Morin, but given the opportunities to win extra big and the interactive element that links up tribal casinos across state lines, the game is expected to be a hit.</p>
<p>Bingo Treasures will be a hit with tribal operators as well as it will attract new business for them, bringing more players in and driving add-on purchases, assured Morin.</p>
