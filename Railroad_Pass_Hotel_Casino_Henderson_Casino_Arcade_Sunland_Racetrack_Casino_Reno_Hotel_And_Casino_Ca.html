<p>Zia Park Casino Kidnap Video May Not Be All It Seems</p>

<p>Security video of a New Mexico woman apparently being kidnapped from the Zia Park Casino Hotel Racetrack, close to the border with Texas, is now being reevaluated by investigators.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Sept. 8, 2022, police responded to reports of a possible kidnapping at Zia Park. On September 9, the Hobbs Police Department released a video provided by the casino.</p>
<p>It appeared to show a suspect chasing down a woman in the casino parking lot, tackling her, and then forcefully bundling her into a silver Chrysler 300. The woman was quickly identified as 35-year-old Erica Martinez from Hobbs. Her suspected kidnapper was Jonathan Zaragoza.</p>
<p>Police asked for the publicâ€™s help, and the video surveillance and screenshots from the casino were shared on social media.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Sept. 10, officers spotted the silver Chrysler in the Carlsbad area, 70 miles southwest of Hobbs. They located Martinez and Zaragoza in a nearby property at around 9 pm. Martinez was unharmed.</p>
<p>Hobbs police said in a media release Saturday that Martinez was being interviewed and that criminal charges against Zaragoza were pending the completion of their investigation.</p>
<p>But police are now examining whether the events depicted in the video might have been misconstrued.</p>
<p>Camera Never Lies</p>
<p>Zaragoza has not been charged with kidnapping, according to court records seen by The Hobbs News-Sun. He was booked into the Eddy County Detention Center for violating probation on a 2019 conviction for meth trafficking and released Wednesday.</p>
<p>He also violated probation terms in 2021 on charges of battery on a household member, interference with communications, and property damage to a household member, court records show.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Martinez was arrested on an outstanding warrant after she failed to appear in court on a July 2022 charge of driving with a suspended license. She has since been released from jail and is due back in court on Oct. 13.</p>
<p>Smoking Gun?</p>
<p>But the crux of the case may lie in a discovery made inside the casino during the investigation into the suspected kidnapping. A purse allegedly lost by Martinez contained several cards in her name and 226 fentanyl pills.</p>
<p>Investigators are now working on the theory Zaragoza and Martinez fled Hobbs in a panic to avoid investigation and arrest, Carlsbad Police Department Capt. Jesse Rodriguez told The News-Sun.</p>
<p>And what appeared to observers to be a terrifying abduction could actually have been a frantic attempt by one criminal to protect another.</p>
<p>Police say the investigation into the incident is ongoing. The video can be viewed on the Hobbs Police Department Facebook page.</p>
