    <h1>Casinos In Cheyenne Wyoming Mgm Casino Ohio Casino In Tennessee Casino De Niro Foxwoods Casino Conne</h1>

<p>Casino is prolonging KYC certification.On top of this,the casino's customer service representatives statements are contradicting what is on the website.I have been going through this KYC verification since September 28th.I have received multiple emails from customer support and their banking department.After uploading my documents,it was stated that it could take up to 3-5 buisness days for verification.Its been almost a month.I received an email stating a selfie was needed to complete verification.I sent the selfie.. still nothing.Then I received an email stating my documents were poor quality.I resent them..still nothing.If poor quality was the issue,why would you email me asking for a selfie only,why not tell me then the photos were poor quality then.</p>
<p>Next issue.Website states that if you have any problems with withdrawal to contact customer support.When I did contact them customer service stated that they have nothing to do with withdrawal,that's the banking department.so why put that on your website if you can't help customers.</p>
<p>Next issue..Received emails stating that verification will not start until a withdrawal request has been initiated.Thats impossible because a withdrawal request cannot be initiated until you submit documents and are approved by KYC.They have your account locked to where you cannot request a withdrawal.I have been KYC verified on other casinos and bitcoin.com without any problems This casino is giving me the run around to collect my winnings.I deposited $10.00 worth of Bitcoin as a verification deposit on September 27th or 28th,like I was told to do.The funds were not credited to my account and i was told they would not be until my account is $1.00 or lower.How do I get my account down to that much without withdrawing my winnings?It's like the are forcing me to play all my winnings back,which I am not going to do.Its like they are holding my own personal money hostage until i give up my winnings.like blackmailing me with my own hardearned money.why are they refusing to verify me.I won that money fair and square.They lie to their customers to get them to play.nothing in their website concerning withdrawal is true</p>
