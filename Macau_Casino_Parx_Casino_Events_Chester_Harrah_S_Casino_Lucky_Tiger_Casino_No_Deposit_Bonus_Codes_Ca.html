    <h1>Macau Casino Parx Casino Events Chester Harrah S Casino Lucky Tiger Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Ca</h1>

<p>In case I overlooked anything, please, feel free to let me know. Otherwise, I am afraid if everything above is correct, we will not be able to help you with the matter, and the complaint will be closed/rejected.</p>
<p>You accumulated the disputed funds with a no-deposit bonus, while you did not make a deposit for almost 1 year. If all players played in such a way, with only free money given by the casino, while they could only win and withdraw winnings (without a chance to lose), it would not make sense for online casinos to provide their services at all.</p>
<p>We are able to accept such a situation in specific circumstances, but since we are talking about no-deposit bonuses and winnings from them (and it seems like you used many no-deposit bonuses before you won), and it is industry standard that online casinos require a deposit between no-deposit bonuses or prior to requesting a withdrawal, we accept such rules, and your game history shows it was breached. Each player is obliged to read the Terms and Conditions, and you accepted them at least during registration. If you did not understand the rules completely, it was necessary to ask the casino customer service about it before their acceptance.</p>
<p>Rule 8.3.1. is clear and says you have to make a deposit in case there are any winnings won from a no-deposit bonus. In your game history, I can see there was a bonus balance of 3.67 RUB prior to winning the significant amount. At this point, you were supposed to make a deposit of at least 300 RUB in order to continue playing with the bonus funds or to withdraw them. Thus, this rule was breached because you continued playing with 3.67 RUB.</p>
<p>Is this rule clear to you, please? Basically, it was also stated in one of your screenshots above.</p>
<p>"8.3.1. We do not impose a wager on no deposit funds. Unless otherwise specified in the promotion, the bonus amount does not need to be wagered. Also, any winnings received when playing with signup bonuses and free bonuses that do NOT require a deposit will only be available after a deposit of 300 RUB or the equivalent sum in another currency is made. "</p>
<p>Although the casino refers to rule 8.3. which is written a bit user-unfriendly, and it was likely not applied in the correct way, I found another rule in the casino's Terms and Conditions (available HERE ):</p>
<p>In the meantime, I went through the whole case and the casino's rules again, and currently, we are looking at the situation differently. Allow me to please explain a few things.</p>
<p>We believe the data is from the complainant's casino account. However, the screenshot does not show the important details that we would like to check. In such a form, it could mean there were 2 operations, from which the first one could have caused a loss of the bonus funds, and the player could have won from the second one, while the bonus funds could have been lost by performing the first operation. In such a case, it would mean that rule 8.3. was not breached. But, it is not clear in the screenshot provided. Therefore, I also asked you about special Terms and Conditions for the bonuses in question. In addition, rule 8.3. says nothing about 2 or more consecutive no-deposit bonuses directly. It explains a situation in which it is possible to claim another bonus, but it is written in wording that could be difficult to understand for a regular player, and it does not completely explain a situation with a possible remaining bonus balance. Last but not least, the casino allows it.</p>
<p>Greetings all,</p>
<p>I am sorry for the delay.</p>
