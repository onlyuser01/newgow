<p>Leva Oustigoff, Jr., 58, of Cumberland, WI., was indicted on eight different counts of embezzlement, the US Attorney’s Office said in a recent statement.</p>
<p>The counts began approximately in December 2015, and lasted until about January 2018, federal officials further claim in a statement. The largest single amount in any of the counts was about $20,000. If convicted, Oustigoff faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison on each count.</p>
<p>Oustigoff was given the summons to appear before a federal court following last week’s indictment. Currently, he has not been arrested. Nor is he in custody.</p>
<p>Court Date to Come</p>
<p>His initial court appearance also has not been set, according to the office of Wisconsin US Attorney Scott C. Blader. That date and time will be scheduled by court officials.</p>
<p>Oustigoff is expected to appear before Western Wisconsin federal Magistrate Stephen Crocker. It will likely be an appearance via Zoom rather than in-person because of coronavirus risk.</p>
<p>The indictment is a result of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the IRS. The St. Croix tribe cooperated, federal officials said.</p>
<p>The Turtle Lake Casino is operated by the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin. A spokeswoman for the US Attorney’s office on Tuesday declined to release more details on the case.</p>
<p>NIGC Sent Notice to Tribe on Questionable Expenses</p>
<p>Last year, it was claimed the St. Croix Chippewa of Wisconsin allegedly used casino funds to pay over $301,000 to Lawrence Larsen between 2015 and 2017 for consulting services on marijuana and related products.</p>
<p>He was paid from money generated at St. Croix Casino Turtle Lake because of the tribe’s interest in growing marijuana to produce hemp and Cannabidiol (CBD).</p>
<p>Casino funds were also used to pay for Larsen’s first-class flights to Hawaii, Atlanta, and Seattle. Additionally, he was given $21,247 in casino funds for a 4×4 off-road vehicle, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.</p>
<p>The payments were among those highlighted by the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) in its Notice of Violation (NOV) dated April 11, 2019.</p>
<p>The NIGC is a national regulator that monitors tribal gaming. It claims the money paid to Larsen is among the $1.5 million that was spent improperly by the tribe. Last year, the NIGC sent the tribe a 29-page Notice of Violation (NOV) listing 527 infringements of tribal and federal rules.</p>
<p>Tribe Asked to Pay $4.5M</p>
<p>In August, the tribe was asked to pay $4.5 million in fines for alleged wrongdoing, according to Law360, an online legal publication.</p>
<p>The fine was lowered by the NIGC from $5.5 million because of hardship from the coronavirus pandemic on the tribe, Law360 said.</p>
