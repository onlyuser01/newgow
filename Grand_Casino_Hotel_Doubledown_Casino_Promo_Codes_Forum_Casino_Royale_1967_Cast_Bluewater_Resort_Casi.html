    <h1>Grand Casino Hotel Doubledown Casino Promo Codes Forum Casino Royale 1967 Cast Bluewater Resort Casi</h1>

<p>I was not in bonus play when those bets were made. The history is not available to me to vote as el royale stated it was. I have made them aware of the issue with no resolution or acknowledgement of the issue at hand.</p>
<p>Furthermore as I said before the slot machine 777 they say i bet over 10 on during bonus play allows players to hold reels after initial bet/spin.. which my initial bet was $1. If you hold different reels from the initial spin then the game adjusts the bet amount depending on the reel held, so with that said I would have not been able to play the slot machine as it is intended, therefore you should not allow players to play a game if it would breach your policy.</p>
<p>None of my pay funds could have been bonus money or I would not be able to withdraw it .. so how could I have been playing bonus at that time. Humm... you also threatened me making false threats so that I would not pursue the actions stated against the casino.</p>
<p>I have contacted and been advised by an attorney who is very versed in the gaming industry so I feel I am worth in my bounds to continue as I feel needed to attempt to obtain what is fair and just.</p>
<p>Attaching me is not cool either. Shows you how you all do business there. Not very customer friendly, only if you are playing and depositing but if you have any concerns about your withdraw they don't help you with shit or pay if they can get away with it, and if you still buck their system to keep the money you won. You get attacked and threatened in a thug like, violent manner.</p>
<p>Not cool at all.</p>
