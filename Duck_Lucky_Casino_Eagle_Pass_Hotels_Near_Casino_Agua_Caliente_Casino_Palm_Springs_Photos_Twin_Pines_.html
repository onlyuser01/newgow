<p>The latest multi-million-dollar sponsorship deal is lauded as one of the largest for the esports sector</p>
<p>One of the most recognizable and influential gaming organizations in the world, FaZe Holdings Inc., announced a new strategic sponsorship agreement by teaming up with the leading online gambling operator, Rollbit. Details regarding the new multi-million esports sponsorship deal emerged today.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the groundbreaking agreement, Rollbit will be designated as a global partner of FaZe Clan’s Counter-Strike team. Currently, according to CS2 Valve World Ranking, the team holds the number one rank for the game.</p>
<p>Rollbit and FaZe Clan confirmed that the new partnership is “focused exclusively outside of the United States.” Ultimately, the collaboration represents a milestone achievement for FaZe Clan but it is also expected to propel the growth of Rollbit.</p>
<p>The announced collaboration comes at a time when esports viewership continues to grow. GameSquare Holdings, in collaboration with Stream Hatchet, its wholly owned analytics and business intelligence platform, released a report earlier this month, highlighting an uptick in esports viewership for last year. According to the report, viewership in 2023 hit 2.76 billion hours, marking an increase of 4% year-over-year.</p>
<p>The deal with FaZe Clan follows another important sponsorship announced by Rollbit recently. Back in September, the company became the new European Betting partner of SSC Napoli, the globally recognized Italian soccer club. At the time, the duo confirmed that soccer fans and bettors alike can expect engaging activations and exciting experiences.</p>
<p>Sam Norman, Rollbit’s head of partnership, praised the collaboration with FaZe Clan, adding that their CS team currently holds the top spot according to global rankings. “We have long admired FaZe Clan and look forward to joining their global audience of over 500 million social followers,” he said. Norman pointed out that Rollbit is looking forward to seeing FaZe Clan’s CS team retain their leadership position during this season. Finally, he spoke about the importance of the new deal, confirming that Rollbit continues to grow its portfolio of partners.</p>
<p>“This collaboration marks another milestone for Rollbit as we continue to expand our sponsorship portfolio with other leading sports organizations.“ Sam Norman, head of partnerships at Rollbit</p>
<p>Erik Anderson, FaZe Clan’s president, shared the thrill of Rollbit’s head of partnerships. He explained that the collaboration with Rollbit represents one of the largest sponsorships to date in esports and CS.</p>
<p>Anderson deemed the deal with Rollbit an important milestone for FaZe Clan, confirming that it underlines the organization’s dedication to delivering exceptional entertainment and ensuring excellence. Finally, he said that FaZe Clan is thrilled about the deal with the leading iGaming operator.</p>
