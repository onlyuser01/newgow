    <h1>Running Aces Casino Minnesota Casino In Scottsdale Milky Way Casino Download Wildwood Casino Resorts</h1>

<p>I really wanted to know if this is proper for a casino to do if so I will be wiser from your response but it not I need to know</p>
<p>I deposited and did not win but my deposit came with a free chip I played till I completed the wager. I contacted support and asked withdrawal process he asked if I knew Jennifer and I said yes she was my girlfriend</p>
<p>He said her account had the same phone number as mine and to correct this he would have to take all my winning to put knew phone number in her account. We sent him her Id we we communicated with live support on two different lines and she lives at another address so not the same house hold</p>
<p>My question is was vegas rush within there rights to take the money after they verified we were two different people and two different house holds</p>
<p>Or should they have corrected the Mistake and honored what I had won</p>
<p>I look forward to your response and thank you for all the work u do in helping player find the legimat casino</p>
