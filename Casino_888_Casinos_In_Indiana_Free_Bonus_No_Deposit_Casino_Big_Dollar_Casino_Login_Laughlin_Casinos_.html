<p>Famous developer of software and games for the iGaming industry Stakelogic expanded further its European reach after announcing a new strategic partnership. On Thursday, the company confirmed it joined forces with the up-and-coming online casino operator in Latvia, FeniBet.</p>
<p>The terms of the new content deal see Stakelogic strengthen its presence in the country and expand the reach of its products even further. Thanks to the deal, FeniBet will benefit from accessing leading and popular games from Stakelogic. Overall, the deal will help boost the operator's portfolio, which in turn is expected to help it continue its growth and gain a leadership position in the market.</p>
<p>In a statement released on March 16, 2023, FeniBet's Head of IT, Martins Opmanis, said: "Stakelogic is rapidly gaining popularity, and we want our customers to enjoy its classic and modern video slots." Last but not least, the Head of IT noted: "We look forward to introducing Stakelogic flagship Super Stake feature to elevate our playersâ€™ experience on FeniBet."</p>
<p>Danila Dzehs, Stakelogic's Senior Sales Manager, was also excited about the new collaboration with FeniBet in Latvia. "FeniBet is a top tier operator in Latvia and this partnership further establishes Stakelogic as a leading content provider," he said. In conclusion, Dzehs noted: "Our games are proven in Latvia and will allow the operator to elevate the experience it offers to players."</p>
<p>Besides boosting FeniBet's game portfolio, the new deal helps Stakelogic strengthen its position as a leading provider of engaging iGaming content. Thanks to the new deal, globally-recognized and popular titles such as Devil's Trap, Wild Buzz, El Cowboy Megaways, Cash Express, as well as the recently launched Diamond Staxx MultiplaysTM will reach new audiences in Latvia.</p>
<p>The latest deal in Latvia comes on the heels of another European-facing collaboration announced by Stakelogic. Earlier this week, the company strengthened its presence in Greece via a new deal with Fonbet. That collaboration is expected to help the operator by strengthening its offering while at the same time expanding further Stakelogic's presence in another strategic European iGaming market.</p>
<p>Before that, the company once again expanded the reach of its iGaming content via a deal with PepperMill Casino in Belgium. The recent partnership saw the casino operator tap into leading titles including classic slots and Stakelogic Live games.</p>
<p>Currently, Stakelogic offers a wide range of iGaming content that includes classic slots, fruit-themed games and live casino titles. The company's products stand out with quality graphics, engaging bonus features and the famous Super Stake feature, a rewarding functionality that is available for modern video slot games, as well as classic titles.</p>
