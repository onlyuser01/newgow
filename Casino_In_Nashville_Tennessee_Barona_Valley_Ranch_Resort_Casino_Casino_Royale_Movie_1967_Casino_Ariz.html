<p>Las Vegas sportsbooks are under scrutiny following reports of suspicious betting on the UNLV football game against New Mexico last month. The Rebels opened as 9-point favorites, and the line quickly soared to as high as 16½ before UNLV secured a decisive 56-14 victory over the Lobos on November 4.</p>
<p>US Integrity Launches Investigation into Unusual Betting Patterns</p>
<p>The unusual betting patterns triggered alerts received by various sportsbooks, with the Westgate SuperBook vice president, Jay Kornegay, acknowledging that they were notified by US Integrity, an independent sports wagering monitor based in Henderson, reported The Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p>
<p>Caesars Sportsbook also confirmed receiving the alert, emphasizing that it was a matter that concerned the entire industry.</p>
<p>While Kornegay expressed that they did not observe any suspicious activity at their sportsbook, he noted that the absence of new accounts specifically targeting the UNLV game would have been a red flag for them.</p>
<p>US Integrity, monitoring betting activity for over 150 clients in 36 states, including the Mountain West Conference, is currently involved in investigating the matter. However, US Integrity’s co-founder and CEO, Matthew Holt, declined to comment, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation.</p>
<p>Nevada Gaming Control Board Maintains Silence on Investigation</p>
<p>The Nevada Gaming Control Board, as part of its standard regulatory practice, neither confirmed nor denied any ongoing investigation into the suspicious betting activity.</p>
<p>One notable wager on the game drew attention, as a bettor at the BetMGM sportsbook at the Bellagio placed a substantial $200,000 bet on the Rebels with a spread of -13, aiming to win $181,000. The Mirage sportsbook manager, Scott Shelton, described it as the largest UNLV bet he had ever seen.</p>
<p>Despite the suspicions raised by the betting activity, UNLV football remained adamant that it did not involve the university.</p>
<p>Rebels coach Barry Odom told the Action Network that during the game, he did not observe anything unusual, emphasizing their focus on taking control early and securing the win.</p>
<p>New Mexico’s athletic director, Eddie Nunez, confirmed being notified about the suspicious betting activity a week after the game by US Integrity. Nunez stated that the coaching staff had no knowledge of any wrongdoing, attributing the significant loss to a lackluster performance rather than any external factors. While the investigation is ongoing, the sportsbooks are reviewing the unusual line movement and large bets, trying to determine whether it was a result of informed betting strategies or potentially illicit activities.</p>
