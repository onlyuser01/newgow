    <h1>Online Crypto Casino Casino Riverboat Four Winds Casino New Buffalo Lucky Win Casino Cannery Hotel C</h1>

<p>I canceled the pending withdrawals because I thought I would withdraw everything at once. So far everything has always worked. But as I said the first 300 on payout were without any bonus.</p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>I charged 50 euros via Paysafe this morning. Then I had 300 euros on payout without any bonus.</p>
<p>Then I used the bonus spins and converted them to 100 euros.</p>
<p>I then canceled the payment and paid out again. See the screenshot.</p>
<p>My €300 from front play with no bonus plus 100 from bonus.</p>
<p>So a total of 400 euros.</p>
<p>Now my 300 euros have been canceled! (which were earned without a bonus)</p>
<p>That has never happened to me here, I played correctly and as I said, the first 300 were paid out without a bonus. Check out my transaction history.</p>
<p>Didn't use the free spins until 11:16. (you can see the screenshot) By then I had already had €300 on withdrawal without a bonus being taken. Only deposited €50 and earned normally.</p>
<p>From 11:16 I started with the free spins after I had 300 to pay out. and I implemented this correctly and converted it to €100.</p>
<p>Don't know how something like that can happen until now everything was always correct. always pay a lot. And I earned everything legally.</p>
<p>Expect them to look at all of this and give me back my missing 300 as this was properly earned with no bonus. My account balance was €400 and I would have liked to have paid this out as it should be.</p>
