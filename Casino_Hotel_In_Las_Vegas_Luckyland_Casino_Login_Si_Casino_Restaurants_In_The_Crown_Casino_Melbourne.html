    <h1>Casino Hotel In Las Vegas Luckyland Casino Login Si Casino Restaurants In The Crown Casino Melbourne</h1>

<p>Thank you very much for your emails and replies, Mylife. Let me start by saying, that self-exclusion from one sister casino, doesn't automatically mean that players will be prevented from registering at all sister casinos. Here the situation is a little bit more complicated because the casino itself decided to close your account as a way to protect you. Not because they had to, but because they wanted to.</p>
<p>However, these casinos do not share the same license, and they do not state that self-exclusion is active in all the other associated websites. Therefore there is no way that such players could be stopped from creating accounts at each sister casino.</p>
<p>In this case, the casino found out that you have been self-excluded from one other casino they share their database of players with. Even if the casino didn't have to, they decided to block you here as well.</p>
<p>The casino can close players' accounts at any time for whatever reasons as long the remaining balance will be refunded. Since the casino voluntarily as a goodwill gesture decided to close your account, even if they didn't have to, we believe that the casino proceeded correctly by returning your unspent balace.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since you officially haven't been self-excluded from this specific casino or registered at Gamstop, these casinos do not share the same license, and the self-exclusion officially isn't applied to all sister casinos, you couldn't be prevented from registering and depositing. However, you could be stopped and prevented from spending more, which the casino did, therefore there isn't any valid reason for asking for a deposit refund.</p>
<p>I understand that this is a very complicated issue, but truly, there is no legal rule that we could use to confront the casino and force it to refund all your deposits.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is not much more we could do to support you in this case. Please, do not hesitate to let me know if there is anything else I could help you with, otherwise, I will be forced to reject this complaint.</p>
