    <h1>Firelake Casino Dreams Casino No Deposit Bonus Codes Pechanga Resort Casino California Hotel Casino</h1>

<p>I have been a member of King Johnnie VIP site Kash Kings since September 2020. I have played regularly and most weeks exclusively at Kash Kings both depositing and withdrawing without incident. Up to this week i have been mostly happy with the site even though i'm not really treated like a VIP. Since becoming a VIP my VIP host has only made proactive personal contact with me once which was to introduce himself. I have emailed him for help maybe 4 or 5 times with mixed results. A couple of these times he hasn't responded and most recently he has responded but not helped.</p>
<p>My VIP host had previously told me that if i was on a losing streak i was welcome to contact him or chat to ask for a bonus. Last week i contacted chat to ask for a bonus and was told "no room to add anything". It seemed odd as my net losses for the last 10 days had been over $2000. I sent a follow up email to my VIP host who told me he had checked my account and added a $50 bonus. Happily i checked my account but no bonus added. I emailed my VIP host again to let him know that the bonus wasn't added but received no response.</p>
<p>The next day was my birthday...One of the main benefits of being a Kash Kings VIP member is the bespoke Birthday Bonus. This benefit is promoted as 'Winners like you deserve to be treated in style. That means the full VIP treatment whenever your special day rolls around. The King likes to make sure your VIP experience is tailor-made - that's why your bespoke birthday bonus will be tailored with the utmost care to suit your gaming style'.</p>
<p>I never heard from my VIP host or Kash Kings on my birthday but when i logged into my account there was a $50 Birthday Bonus there. Without any attached communication i had no way of knowing if this was the missing $50 bonus or the Bespoke Birthday Bonus or something else. The next day i emailed my VIP Host who replied that it was a system generated thing. No mention of the missing $50 bonus he said he put in my account or what happened to the Bespoke Birthday Bonus. I haven't played there since.</p>
<p>I know this isn't the kind of complaint you usually get but I have invested &amp; turned over a lot of money to maintain this membership. Before i close my account I just want to understand if all Kash Kings VIPs miss out on benefits/treated poorly or do i just have a bad host?</p>
<p>I have tried to resolve this myself by contacting Kash Kings chat to ask how to change VIP hosts but they immediately tried to connect me to my VIP host so i left the chat. I appreciate any assistance you can give as I have no other contact points to raise this with King</p>
