<p>Nuvei has extended its relationship with Dutch gaming operator Holland Casino and has introduced a new payment solution that will allow players of the online casino brand to benefit from instant payouts. This will be made possible through the integration of a solution called SEPA Instant Credit Transfers which is now one of the available options in the cashier section for players.</p>
<p>Holland Casino Online is one of the licensed and registered operators in the country and holds an official license from the Dutch Gaming Authority. Therefore, the company is keen to make it possible for players to enjoy the best possible experience on the website and benefit from quick transactions. Fast payments have become a cornerstone for the offer of many online brands that want to inspire trust and loyalty in their customers.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Nuvei assured that players would no longer need to wait for hours or days to have their payout requests settled. The SEPA instant transfer upgrade offers a significant boost to the overall banking experience and makes for more flexible and reliable cashout options across the board.</p>
<p>Nuvei and Holland Casino Online are also long-term partners having launched together this year with Nuvei recognized by the brand as its official payment provider. The new partnership is a step further in the collaboration between the companies and the end product they are capable of providing customers.</p>
<p>Holland Casino Online Manager Nicolas Fleiderman who said that the brand was very happy to go ahead with the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer, offering a significant improvement for players.</p>
<p>"We have always been determined to offer Dutch players the best iGaming experience in the market, including superior deposit and payout experiences, which is why we chose to partner with Nuvei to launch our iGaming platform," Fleiderman added.</p>
<p>Nuvei President Yuval Ziv was similarly pleased with the partnership and hailed the opportunity that the payment provider will enable Holland Casino Online players to benefit from advanced next-generation withdrawal and payment options. This argues Ziv, is another opportunity for the company to demonstrate its commitment to improving payment experiences for the iGaming industry globally.</p>
<p>In July, Holland Casino Online teamed up with NetEnt to roll out the supplierâ€™s award-winning and industry-defining content as part of its own library of games and gaming options.</p>
