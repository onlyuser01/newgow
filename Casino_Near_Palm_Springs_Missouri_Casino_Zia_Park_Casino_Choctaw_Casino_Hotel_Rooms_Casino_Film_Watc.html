<p>FanDuel Group has signed a partnership with Mischief, a marketing agency, for the US market. The companies will work together on promoting the FanDuel Casino brand as the group prepares for the expansion of iGaming legalization in the country and North America. After Ontario launched private gambling last April, FanDuel and other sports betting giants have been keen to expand their reach in the space.</p>
<p>Mischief @ No Fixed Address will assist FanDuel in promoting its table games, live casino, and slots products through the blanket casino brand. Presently, FanDuel Casino is represented in states such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and West Virginia. The company plans to continue scaling up its reach in the regulated iGaming market as soon as new markets become available.</p>
<p>The creative agency will be in charge of promoting FanDuel Casino via all means necessary to ensure that consumers end up choosing the platform as their preferred iGaming partner. FanDuel Group VP of Casino Brand Strategy Daniele Philipps elaborated on this partnership and what it meant for the future success of the iGaming brand.</p>
<p>Phillips spoke about significant changes coming to the iGaming industry. Despite the fact regulators are tight-lipped about potential changes in online casino legislation, the consensus is now that most states have passed sports betting laws iGaming may be coming next. Many jurisdictions in North America usually discuss sports betting and online casinos together.</p>
<p>That is why, Philips explained, FanDuel has chosen to work with Mischief and help promote its online casino brand as it prepares for what the executive described as "uncharted waters." Mischief CCO and Co-Founder Greg Hahn were equally confident about the upcoming partnership.</p>
<p>He assured that Mischief was in a position to leverage the FanDuel Casino branding and incorporate new marketing strategies that would help develop its digital and online footprint. Hahn said that the future success of the FanDuel Casino brand would not be too difficult given the team behind the company, calling FanDuelâ€™s employees savvy, strategic and out-of-the-box thinkers.</p>
<p>Legislative efforts in the iGaming space are continuing across the United States. Traditionally, iGaming revenue brings much better benefits for states compared to sports betting. One concern against the expansion of online casino gambling is whether land-based properties will remain in business and whether different states would be able to handle the potentially higher incidence of problem gambling as more digital gambling unfolds across the United States.</p>
