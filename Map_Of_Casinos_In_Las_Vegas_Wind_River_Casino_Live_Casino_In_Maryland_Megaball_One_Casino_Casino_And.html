<p>Connective Games has confirmed the closure of its Russian development studio as part of a strategic overview of its international operations</p>
<p>The company said that it undertook the measure in order to guarantee the sustainability of its business and not disrupt the flow of product delivery moving forward.</p>
<p>Russian companies have been buffeted by an increasing number of sanctions issued in response to the countryâ€™s illegitimate invasion of neighboring Ukraine. Connective Games confirmed that the decision was a difficult one as the company has deep roots in the country, with its first development studio launched in Russia.</p>
<p>Stuck Between a Rock and a Hard Place</p>
<p>However, the present geopolitical challenges made maintaining business arms in Russia no longer sustainable. There is still something good to take out of this development, as the company is confident that its decision to withdraw will also result in better logistics and strengthen its overall presence in markets while carrying no risks for its business.</p>
<p>Connective Games has been marching forth confidently, announcing the opening of numerous studios across Europe and beyond. The company launched new local studios in Turkey, Serbia, and Armenia among others. The expansions were announced in November, and they are a part of a much larger and more ambitious plan.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Connective Games will seek to increase its presence even further in specific markets. Those include regions such as Latin America, Asia, and other European jurisdictions. Presently, the company is headquartered in Malta and holds multiple international licenses.</p>
<p>In March, Parimatch Tech, another prominent gambling operator and tech company, withdrew its operations from the Russian market and condemned the illegitimate war led by Russia against Ukraine, a country the company identifies with. Other companies around the world have responded. LeoVegas symbolically suspended betting on Russian and Belarussian sports in May.</p>
