<p>The market-leading sports betting and gaming entertainment company, BetMGM, announced the launch of a retail sports betting outlet at MGM Springfield in Massachusetts. On Tuesday, the operator confirmed it launched sports betting at its new BetMGM Sportsbook and Lounge.</p>
<p>The new location offers supreme entertainment for sports fans and offers a 45-foot LED viewing wall. There are 18 sports betting kiosks as well as four betting windows for the convenience of visitors that would like to place wagers. Moreover, MGM Rewards enables the visitors to benefit from further prizes not only at this location but throughout all MGM Resorts destinations that are more than 20.</p>
<p>Massachusetts legalized sports wagering back in August last year. Yet, the retail sports betting market launched on January 31, 2023. The launch of BetMGM's sports betting outlet coincided with the first day of legal wagers in the state. With that in mind, Massachusetts is yet to launch its online/mobile sports betting market.</p>
<p>The state's first wagers at BetMGM Sportsbook were placed by the legendary Boston hockey player Ray Bourque as well as Domenic J. Sarno, Springfield's Mayor.</p>
<p>In a statement released on January 31, 2023, MGM Resorts' President and COO, Northeast Group, Chris Kelley, said that the company is excited to see the introduction of sports betting in Massachusetts. Moreover, he added: "We are incredibly grateful for the tireless work of the State delegation to bring this historic bill to the finish line, and to the MGC for crafting the necessary regulations."</p>
<p>Finally, Kelley said: "The BetMGM Sportsbook at MGM Springfield allows us to create even more one-of-a-kind engagements for our guests while generating tax revenue and job opportunities for our community."</p>
<p>BetMGM's CEO, Adam Greenblatt, added: "The BetMGM Sportsbook at MGM Springfield is a phenomenal sports betting hub designed for New England's passionate sports fans." He explained that the launch in Massachusetts represents a milestone achievement and predicted that BetMGM will deliver unique experiences for sports fans in the state.</p>
<p>Mayor Domenic J. Sarno was also excited to see BetMGM launch its retail betting outlet in Springfield. He outlined that the launch marks an important moment for the region. Additionally, Sarno said that the new sports betting outlet creates more jobs and brings economic stimulus to the region.</p>
<p>Finally, the Mayor said: "Thank you to the MGM Springfield team, our local State delegation, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC) and everyone involved for their efforts in making this historic event possible."</p>
