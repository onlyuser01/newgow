    <h1>Mr Lucky Casino Doubledown Casino On Facebook Vip Casino How To Play Casino Games Casino Slots Stake</h1>

<p>The year has barely started, and Ontario is already proving one of the hottest iGaming jurisdictions in North America, with the province attracting significant interest from operators and suppliers.</p>
<p>The latest local development in the market involves Stakelogic, a supplier of casino content, which has just entered the front door through a partnership with Rootz, an established and licensed operator. This comes on the tail of other important developments for the supplier in key markets such as Italy and Greece back in Europe. However, Ontario is part of Stakelogic’s North American expansion strategy.</p>
<p>The supplier will deliver games from both of its divisions to wit Stakelogic and Stakelogic Live, which focus on developing slots and live casino games respectively, giving Rootz a serious content boost in the process. Stakelogic brings a variety of games, among which are such popular options as Rooster Mobs, Wild Wild Bass 3, Super 6 Timer, Mega Runner, and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>Players will further get their hands on other popular mechanics and options, such as Stakelogic’s Super Wheel designed to enhance the consumer expeirence and offer more opportunities for players and casinos to bond and instill a sense of loyalty. Commenting on this fresh opportunity, Stakelogic CCO Olga Bajela has welcomed the opportunity to work with Rootz, which she described as one of the big-name operators in the province.</p>
<p>Bajela was not shy about blowing the studio’s own tooth, either, saying: "No other studio can provide such a broad range of products, with our slots offering an unrivaled online casino experience to players."</p>
<p>The partnership was naturally welcomed by Rootz CEO Sam Brown who stressed the importance of content in the regulated iGaming market and argued that having access to the best game is what drove differentiation locally, hailing the Stakelogic deal as a key step for the company.</p>
<p>"We are delighted to integrate Stakelogic’s impressive classic and video slots into our game lobby," Brown added. In the meantime, Ontario has attracted a fair bit of interest over the past years, with companies such as LuckyCasino, an operator, and suppliers Octoplay and Peter &amp; Sons entering the market in a bid to strengthen their global footprints and ensure presence in one of the hottest online casino markets in the world.</p>
