<p>Racing industry content provider XB Net continues to expand its global footprint and popularize North American horse and greyhound racing by entering into a partnership deal with LiveScore Bet, the sportsbook of LiveScore Group.</p>
<p>“We’re thoroughly delighted to be teaming up with LiveScore Bet, one of the hottest sports betting properties around.” Simon Fraser, SVP, International, XB Net</p>
<p>Live Pictures, Data and Betting Opportunities</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, LiveScore Bet will utilize live pictures, data and sports betting services from more than 50 race tracks in North America, to allow it to leverage a steady stream of betting opportunities, apply reliable agility to its programming timetable and cut dwell-time for its customers.</p>
<p>”The LiveScore Group remains one of the planet’s premier providers for real-time sports updates and streaming services, so this partnership is a ringing endorsement of our own low-latency feeds and dedication to delivering the most accurate data and high-quality pictures.” Simon Fraser, SVP, International, XB Net</p>
<p>The premium content which covers approximately 90% of racing in the US would allow LiveScore Bet access to some of the most prestigious horse races in the world, including Triple Crown events at the Belmont and Preakness Stakes, the Pegasus World Cup and the Breeders’ Cup finale from California.</p>
<p>“LiveScore Bet is committed to innovating and providing our UK audience with the most engaging sports coverage available. XB Net’s digital content, with its advanced data and betting tools on North American racing, fits seamlessly into our offering.” James McKay, Director, Sportsbook, LiveScore Betting and Gaming</p>
<p>The UK-based sportsbook will be able to complement its domestic racing timetable with racing content from a trustworthy source and rapid settlement, and the time difference is also working in favor of the betting brand, letting it slot US racing events starting from 17:00GMT.</p>
<p>“We can’t wait to see how this content is received by our customers, as we launch in time for the climax of the Florida Derby series.” James McKay, Director, Sportsbook, LiveScore Betting and Gaming</p>
<p>North American Events Would Complement Domestic Racing Schedule</p>
<p>The Gulfstream Park’s Florida Derby series, another of the premier horse racing events XB Net will cover under the terms of the deal, is running until the end of March, making is suitable for UK customers due to the East Coast time zone it takes place.</p>
<p>XB Net SVP Fraser outlined the importance of coverage to partners with daily events and betting markets, to allow them to engage with their customers via tailor-made promotional activities for acquisition and retention, hailing the improved visibility for American racing last year and the potential to continue on the same note during the winter months.</p>
<p>Simon Fraser further noted the “peak recreational orientation with the close of the daily domestic cards” for North American racing and the surging levels of retention during these “pivotal evening slots”.</p>
<p>“We’re particularly pleased to also offer a nightly program of two Harness race cards, which will help LiveScore Bet broaden their customer base by introducing fresh formats from our stable of over 40 US Harness tracks.” Simon Fraser, SVP, International, XB Net</p>
<p>The deal with UK-based LiveScore Bet continues to expand XB Net’s global footprint, following a similar deal with Australian sportsbook CrossBet which was signed earlier in February.</p>
