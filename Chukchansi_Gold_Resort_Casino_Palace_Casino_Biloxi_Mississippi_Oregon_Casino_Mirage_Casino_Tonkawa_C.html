    <h1>Chukchansi Gold Resort Casino Palace Casino Biloxi Mississippi Oregon Casino Mirage Casino Tonkawa C</h1>

<p>Playtech, a leading gambling software development company has reinforced its team in the United States with a new chief commercial officer. The one up to the task is Marcus Yoder, a seasoned gambling industry veteran.</p>
<p>Yoder’s Experience Will Benefit Playtech</p>
<p>Yoder has extensive experience in several gambling companies. He has worked for the industry leader International Game Technology for almost four years, serving as the executive director of sales and business development for the Americas and Asia Pacific. He left the company in 2014 and joined Gamblit Gambling a developer of engaging slots titles. He worked as the latter’s vice president of regulated market business development for six years, after which he had a year and a half stint as GameAccount Network’s senior vice president of sales and sales operations. He is currently the advisor of the bet-on-anything platform BETSPARKET.</p>
<p>Yoder’s experience also includes tenures in non-gambling companies and organizations, such as Maraleyo Technology Holdings and Brighter Children.</p>
<p>His extensive experience with various gambling and non-gambling companies paired with his time as an independent market and business development consultant will be a crucial asset for the realization of Playtech’s strategy for the highly-competitive US market. As a part of Playtech, Yoder will have a key role in the US launch of Playtech’s full suite of gambling verticals.</p>
<p>The Appointee Said Innovation Is Playtech’s Strength</p>
<p>Yoder shared that he is delighted to work for the company. He added that one of the main reasons he opted to join Playtech is his trust in the company’s ability to innovate and produce content of supreme quality. Yoder noted that the company excels with its games and he is happy to be a part of this team.</p>
<p>Speaking about innovation, a few weeks ago, Playtech inked a deal with Betfred, agreeing to power the company with an innovative horseracing-inspired bingo game. The so-called Giddy Up Bingo is a digital title that provides iGaming enthusiasts with the feeling of participating in a real derby. In February, Playtech signed a five-year deal with The Jockey Club. As per the agreement, the game developer opted to develop content for the famous Cheltenham Festival, including a new RNG game.</p>
<p>This constant pursuit for innovation has helped the company cement itself as a powerhouse in the world of slot game development. Thanks to its strategic choice to double down on its operations in the United States and Latin America, Playtech saw a 12% increase in its 2021 revenues, outperforming its expectations.</p>
