<p>SG and Oneida Indian Nation break into the NY market with two casinos</p>
<p>Both casino properties will be Caesars branded</p>
<p>Mobile and online betting and gaming are still off the table.</p>
<p>Scientific Games and Oneida Indian Nation are going to offer sports betting wagers leveraging SG’s OpenSports platform.</p>
<p>SGC and Oneida Indian Nation Enter NY Sports Betting Market</p>
<p>Scientific Games Corporation (SGC) has teamed up with the Oneida Indian Nation and launched two sportsbooks at New York casinos, to name Turning Stone Resort in Verona and Point Place Casino in Bridgeport.</p>
<p>Both properties will be operated under the Caesars brand and powered by SGC’s OpenSports suite. This solutions allows the properties to accept over-the-counter bets as well as as integrate a number of specialized screen solutions and self-serving terminals to speed up the process and handle demand.</p>
<p>Turning Stone comes with a 500 sq ft LED screen and LED terminals, all of which will offer HD resolution, love odds as well as in-play options. There will additionally be bars, ticket windows and VIP lounges where dedicated TVs will remain available to people who prefer some privacy instead.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, SGC’s CEO Jordan Levin said:</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to continue our partnership with Oneida Indian Nation and to use our trusted technology to help them reach new bettors.”</p>
<p>This move comes at a moment when Caesars has posted rather dispiriting financial results in the first half year. On the upside, the operator’s revenue grew amid a quicker expansion.</p>
<p>With the announcement of these two properties, New York will see a total of four casinos operate in the state now that sports betting has been officially approved in the Empire State.</p>
<p>On July 16, the Rivers Casino &amp; Resort located in Schenectady was the first to accept a digital wager followed by Tioga Downs in Nichols which launched FanDuel’s digital skin on July 19.</p>
<p>Oneida Secures Best-in-Class Product, Says Levin</p>
<p>The Oneida Indian Nation will benefit from a product that Mr. Levin described as “our quality execution,” referring to the OpenSports platform. This is the fourth state in which SGC have had the opportunity to launch their products. Explaining the benefits of the platform, Mr. Levin elaborated:</p>
<p>“It can be tailored to fit the needs of any customer, and this launch, as our first tribal sports betting opportunity in the U.S. is a perfect example of our truly flexible product solutions.”</p>
<p>Oneida Indian National CEO Ray Halbritter was equally pleased with the news. Mr. Halbritter said that his company was excited to be among the first to launch a sports betting product in New York State as well as integrate the OpenSports system which allows for “a sturdy technological foundation on which we can build as the industry expands.”</p>
<p>New York is the latest state to launch sports betting in full, offering new income opportunities for the state’s coffers. Meanwhile, lawmakers have voted against Senator Joseph Addabbo’s bill that would have seen mobile betting and online poker introduced to the Empire State as well.</p>
<p>Sen. Addabbo has been trying to push through a number of gaming and betting-expanding measures, but most of these efforts have come to an unsuccessful end.</p>
