<p>Slotegrator has received a new license to bring its products to Romania, having obtained the go-ahead by the country’s gaming regulator, ONJN.</p>
<p>The new license will allow Slotegrator, a game distributor and aggregator and online casino and sportsbook software provider to bring its products to market and expand in a new vibrant jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Slotegrator Becomes Licensed Supplier of iGaming in Romania</p>
<p>ONJN has granted Slotegrator a Class 2 license which means that the company can provide its products and services to both Internet casinos and sportsbooks in Romania moving forward.</p>
<p>The development was welcomed by managing director Yana Khaidukova, managing director at Slotegrator, who said that the company stood tall in the industry and has built a successful reputation for providing high-quality games and products for both casinos and sportsbooks.</p>
<p>“We have clients all over the world and our goal is to always offer them the latest trends and the most innovative technologies, Khaidukova added. She continued by saying that Slotegrator was looking forward to new opportunities to justify its position as a market leader and a trusted partner for brands, now in the Romanian gambling market.</p>
<p>Online gaming is getting bigger by the day in Romania, with the total value of the market put at $900 million in gross gaming revenue. Eastern Europe has become a particularly attractive region for iGaming operators, with many enjoying fairly liberal gambling laws, and launching in markets that have not yet been oversaturated by rival businesses.</p>
<p>Romanian iGaming Market Holds Massive Potential</p>
<p>Romania has seen interest from a number of companies over the past months. Push Gaming announced a fresh partnership with Crowd Entertainment and four of its brands earlier in December.</p>
<p>Before that in November, BF Games expanded its reach in the country through a partnership with Stanleybet. The same month, SoftGamings was granted a license by ONJN to proceed and enter the Romanian iGaming market. Overall, Romania’s online gaming market is only getting started with more exciting developments to follow in 2023.</p>
