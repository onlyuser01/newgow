<p>Houston Rockets Overview: What to Expect?</p>
<p>So, Houston are in a very good position. The Rockets have won four out of five games in the NBA season restart faltering, most surprisingly, against the Portland Trail Blazers. Well, this aside, the team has had a fairly straightforward track record, defeating, in a row the Dallas Mavericks, Milwaukee Bucks, LA Lakers, and Sacramento Kings.</p>
<p>The game against San Antonio Spurs is no doubt very important and it would allow the Rockets to cement their current standing in the Western Conference. Yet, the Rockets have a truly outstanding field of athletes with both James Harden and Austin Rivers putting in some great work this season.</p>

<p>The Beard has been averaging 25.1 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 6.3 assists so far. Rivers put in 41 points against the Sacramento Kings which beat all expectations as he averages 9.1 points a game. That was a huge leap right there.</p>
<p>Yet, the Rockets have more powerful teammates they can afford to field, including McLemore and Covington. The Spurs definitely have a tough game ahead of them.</p>
<p>Can the Spurs Make It?</p>
<p>Having a look at the San Antonio Spurs, there is nothing worth overlooking. The team dominated the Pelicans in their most recent brush and had another success, prior to that, beating the Utah Jazz. All in all the team has done very well in the NBA restart even if their seeding is not quite up there yet.</p>
<p>The Spurs have great players as well. Take for example Murray or Belinelli, or even Poetl and White, who are both doing fantastic job, and you have the full picture for the team this season.</p>
<p>Yet, to truly excel, the Spurs still depend on their MVP, DeMar DeRozan who averages 20 points a game but has his special moments where he appears to be virtually unstoppable. Well, playing against Harden and Rivers will definitely require from DeRozan to be on his best in Tuesday’s game.</p>
<p>With hours on the clock and not so much left from the season, the San Antonio Spurs must shoot for the playoffs with every minute of every game.</p>
