    <h1>Sweepslots Casino California Hotel Casino East Ogden Avenue Las Vegas Nv Ignition Casino Connecticut</h1>

<p>PlayStar has been taking its sweet time with the anticipated launch in the United States, and as it waits, the company is making sure to make good friends with the technology and game providers who will define the experience for players. In the latest agreement, PlayStar has teamed up with IGT PlayDigital, IGT’s interactive division which is focusing on creating best-in-class digital and betting gaming content.</p>
<p>PlayStar to Expand iGaming Portfolio with PlayDigital</p>
<p>As a result, PlayStar will feature IGT PlayDigital games on its new casino whose launch is imminent. IGT PlayDigital will not only deliver excellent gameplay options, but also help PlayStar achieve its goal of creating unique and highly-personalized experiences for customers, along with excellent customer service options, and more.</p>
<p>IGT PlayDigital will be an important ally on the journey to excellence as PlayStar seeks to provide its players in New Jersey, and later elsewhere in the United States, with unparalleled and high-added value games and experiences.</p>
<p>Apart from offering logistic and infrastructure support, IGT has a number of excellent games in the portfolio, featuring such titles as Stinkin’ Rich, Lion Dance, Cleopatra Gold, Pixies of the Forest, and more.</p>
<p>IGT PlayDigital will make sure to add a range of other games too including its table and video poker game offers. This will give players the opportunity to explore alternative titles that may appeal to them and prove quite worthwhile in the long term. PlayStar chief business development officer and co-founder Adam Noble said:</p>
<p>“With the U.S. currently being the fastest-growing iGaming region in the world, it’s absolutely crucial that PlayStar hits the ground running by offering players the very best selection of games in the market.”</p>
<p>Giving PlayStar the Needed Entry Boost</p>
<p>The executive welcomed the immense significance of the partnership with IGT PlayDigital and said that the company was in a position to benefit from the excellent titles brought by the company. IGT president of iGaming Gil Rotem struck a similar tone and said that PlayStar Casino’s upcoming launch in New Jersey is something that his company was looking forward to.</p>
<p>He assured that by opting for top-performing titles by IGT, PlayStar was putting itself in a very good decision. There are at least 500 engaging titles to offer customers across the verticals, Rotem assured, and said that PlayStar players are bound to love them.</p>
