<p>Get Ready to Bounce</p>
<p>The slot, which has been described as “all about the Benjamin$” by the company’s head of product Per Lindheimer, has taken the popular Vegas theme and kicked it up a notch using Nolimit City’s unique style.</p>
<p>Players can get ready to embark on a wild Dead Presidents’ trip to Las Vegas while admiring the eye-catching art style and excellent animations.</p>
<p>The state-of-the-art graphic design combines well with the carefully selected hip-hop soundtrack prone to make a lot of heads bounce uncontrollably.</p>
<p>The base game comes with a spectacular 3-3-3-3-3 layout and an impressive selection of game mechanics. The list includes the Nolimit xMechanics xSplit feature, xNudge, and two available variants of xBet which players can tackle in three different ways.</p>
<p>xBET BLUE, xBET RED, xNUDGE WILD, VEGAS$ SPINS &amp; B.I.G. VEGAS$ SPINS</p>
<p>xBET BLUE and xBET RED cost players additional bets. They guarantee a pair of scatters and overlay multipliers, which means players can expect to see the chances of landing a massive win go up considerably when the bonus rounds are engaged.</p>
<p>xBET BLUE for an additional cost of 50%, players are guaranteed a Scatter symbol per spin, along with more than 3x the chances of joining the Vegas$ Spins, and 2x enhanced chances to enter B.I.G. Vegas$ spins.</p>
<p>For an extra cost of 9x the base bet, players will enjoy two Overlay Multipliers x2 and x3 while activating the Enhancers when choosing the xBET RED.</p>
<p>Players can also land additional Scatters as well as enjoy a 15x higher chance to enter Vegas$ Spins. The chance of entering B.I.G. Vegas$ Spins is 50x times higher than the standard when this option is used.</p>
<p>The xNUDGE WILD is a three-row high Wild that replaces all symbols except for Scatters. The Wild always nudges, causing the win multiplier to go up by one unit, before becoming fully visible on the entire reel.</p>
<p>Players who land a minimum of three VEGAS$ SPINS scatter symbols receive nine free spins. This causes the Enhancers to be engaged, turning the Scatters into x2,x3, and x4 Overlay Multipliers.</p>
<p>When landing four or five B.I.G. VEGAS$ SPINS Scatters, players receive 11 or 13 free spins. Additionally, the Enhancers are engaged, turning the Scatters into x2, x3, x4, x5, and x6 Overlay Multipliers.</p>
<p>Last July, the company with offices in Malta, Sweden, India, and Romania signed a partnership agreement with bet365. During the same month, Salsa Technology announced it would add Nolimit City to its aggregation platform.</p>
