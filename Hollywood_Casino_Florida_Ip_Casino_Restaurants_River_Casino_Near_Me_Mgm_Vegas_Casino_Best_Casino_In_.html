<p>ComeOn Group, a leading player in the global iGaming market, has forayed into the German market, after securing a sports betting license. The group will launch three of its brands in the European country, thus expanding its footprint in the region.</p>
<p>ComeOn on Sachsen-Anhalt’s Whitelist</p>
<p>Sachsen-Anhalt, one of Germany’s states, added ComeOn Group to its whitelist of licensed operators. This list is updated every time a new operator receives a license, meaning that the holding successfully fulfilled the regulator’s conditions.</p>
<p>As result, ComeOn Group will launch three of its brands in Germany, namely sunmaker.de, comeonwetten.de and mobilebet.de. This will be ComeOn Group’s first entry in the European country and comes almost a year after the GlüNeuRStV opted to legalize online gaming.</p>
<p>Germany Is Very Strict to Operators</p>
<p>Prior to the GlüNeuRStV, operators in Germany could only offer sports betting offerings on the web. Despite the legal changes, there only one operator currently holds a license to operate online slot games.</p>
<p>Under the GlüNeuRStV, online operators should abide by some very restrictive measures. For example, companies have to impose a $1050 loss limit on all of their customers, regardless of personal income. In addition, customers can bet no more than $1 per spin when playing slot games. Sports betting companies should also to follow a certain set of rules. Notably, they have to adhere to limitations concerning in-play bets.</p>
<p>Because of the restrictive measures, Germany’s sports betting operators are currently trying to sue the country as they demand better operating conditions.</p>
<p>ComeOn’s Recent Activity</p>
<p>In December last year, ComeOn Group also reinforced its presence in the Nordics. Back then, it helped Leap Gaming launch its award-winning casino games in the region’s iGaming market. Earlier that year, ComeOn Group enhanced its offering by signing a deal with Playtech. Thanks to that, ComeOn added the latter’s acclaimed casino and live casino offerings to its brands.</p>
<p>ComeOn Group recently reinforced its presence in Malta. The company vowed to support two sports clubs based in Sliema, the town housing ComeOn’s headquarters. This included Sliema Aquatic Sports Club and Sliema Wanderers FC – two clubs that boast a century worth of traditions and are an integral part of the local sports ecosystem.</p>
<p>In 2021, ComeOn Group was hit by the global landscape changes caused by the COVID pandemic. As result, the company adapted and introduced a global hybrid working model, per which employees were free to choose whether to work in person, from home, or any combination of the two.</p>
