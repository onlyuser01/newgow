    <h1>Wild Casino Online Rivers Casino Events Directions To Hard Rock Casino Century Casino Central City F</h1>

<p>Hi, thank you for pointing this out. They are considered to be reliable, but we already prepared big changes that will be released within 2 weeks. Those changes will be active within 2 weeks. We're going to assign every single review an individual value. That means the player's history and overall activity on our website will influence the review's impact on the overall casino user rating.</p>
<p>I went through all the reviews you mentioned here. I see 2 of them as very suspicious, but I would need to see more data in order to be sure that I can reject them. We constantly get back to some reviews and reject them retroactively based on the new data that we get about the casino and their reviews. For example last week, I rejected around 15 positive reviews for a single casino, only because I finally got enough data that helped us to make a better image about which reviews are fake and which reviews are genuine.</p>
<p>You also need to take into account that casinos who get fake reviews use different strategies. Some motivate real players with bonuses in exchange for the positive reviews. Some ask their employees to write reviews regularly, other have just 1 person who writes the fake reviews on a regular basis, others mix everything mentioned together. It's a really tough and complicated process and we've been improving the user reviews system since we introduced it 1,5 years ago.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'd like to reach the point where we'll have something that we can call "verified reviews". Those reviews would be provided by players who'll provide us a proof showing that they really played in the casino. The problem with fake reviews is everywhere. You can't even trust the restaurant's reviews you see on Google maps. You can pay companies for writing the reviews for you and they won't be written by new users, but by users marked as "the local guide" as well ðŸ˜•</p>
