<p>The original deal was scheduled to expire at the end of 2023 but Paf and Eckerö Linjen were quick to renew it in advance</p>
<p>Casino operator Paf and the Finnish shipping company Eckerö Linjen have penned a new multi-year deal. Under the new agreement, Eckerö Linjen will be able to provide its passengers with renewed and enhanced onboard gaming experiences. The agreement comes just a few days after Paf deepened its ties with Kambi.</p>
<p>The two parties are no strangers to one another, having worked closely together for many years. Their current partnership was scheduled to expire at the end of 2023. However, the two companies have decided to extend their deal in advance in order to capitalize on new opportunities.</p>
<p>Neither company is new to providing gaming in an onboard environment, making Paf and Eckerö Linjen perfect for one another.</p>
<p>As agreed, starting in 2024, Paf will provide enhanced gaming for the passenger ship MS Eckerö, which it already supplies with gaming equipment. The ship operates between Sweden and Åland and, thanks to Paf, can offer passengers thrilling casino products.</p>
<p>For reference, MS Eckerö welcomed a total of 787,930 guests in 2022, which represents a significant increase from the 490,695 people it transported in 2021. As a result, Eckerö Linjen is seeking to step up its game in terms of onboard gambling.</p>
<p>Paf Will Entertain Ship Passengers</p>
<p>Eckerö Linjen’s chief executive officer, Tomas Karlsson, commented on the development, saying that his team has enjoyed a great partnership with Paf so far.</p>
<p>We both have high ambitions and we both know what it takes to adapt our operations to the conditions that exist in an onboard world. Tomas Karlsson, CEO, Eckerö Linjen</p>
<p>Christer Fahlstedt, Paf’s chief executive officer, confirmed that his team has a “solid history” with Eckerö Linjen and added that he is looking forward to working with the shipping company in the coming years.</p>
<p>Fahlstedt said that Eckerö Linjen is an important partner to Paf and promised that Paf will continue supplying it with best-in-class gaming entertainment.</p>
<p>Lasse Danielsson, Paf’s chief operating officer, also commented on the renewed agreement, saying that it will be beneficial for both companies. He remarked that acquiring new machines and adapting them for onboard use can take a while, which is why the early agreement extension was a good call.</p>
<p>We are in a new phase for passenger traffic onboard and the guests traveling after the pandemic have new requirements for their travel. Therefore, we must also adapt our operations with, among other things, modern cashless payment solutions. Lasse Danielsson, COO, Paf</p>
<p>In February this year, Paf inked a deal with Stakelogic, expanding the latter company’s presence in Europe.</p>
