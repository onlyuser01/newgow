<p>Ben Hurst has been appointed as 888 Holdings' Vice President of North American Expansion, SBC News reported.</p>
<p>Hurst is an experienced iGaming veteran who is stepping into an important position and will be tasked with assisting 888 to develop and reach its full potential. He will also work on the SI Sportsbook and SICasino brands which are part of 888's broader strategy for the market in the United States, and explore its full potential across the board. The SI Sportsbook and Casino brands are a collaboration between Sports Illustrated's parent company, Authentic Brands Group, and 888.</p>
<p>Hurst proves a well-seasoned specialist and industry executive, having spent time with Madison Square Garden Entertainment Group, and led projects for The Beacon Theatre, MSG, Radio City, the New York Rangers, New York Knicks and more.</p>
<p>He also served a stint with Paramount Entertainment, and was in charge of the mobile and digital division for a number of networks, including MTV, Comedy Central, Paramount Network, and more. The partnership was welcomed by 888 North America President Howard Mittman who hailed Hurst as a valuable addition to the US team.</p>
<p>Cited by SBC News, Mittman explained the kind of person Hurst was and why the team at 888 was excited to have him in their midst. "Ben has demonstrated exceptional proficiency during his tenure at several top-tier media brands. His extensive understanding of the US digital, sports, and entertainment sectors will be a significant asset. We are eagerly looking forward to collaborating with him," Mittman concluded.</p>
<p>The appointment of a new industry expert to lead the company’sgrowth in the North American market is not a chance event either. The United States is quickly becoming one of the most interesting, regulated gambling markets – both in terms of sports betting and iGaming potential, two verticals in which 888 has more than 25 years of experience.</p>
<p>Although the company has experienced some challenging performance over the past months, including William Hill, the newly-acquired business asset, being hit with a £19.2m ($23.73m) penalty by the UK Gambling Commission. Although Q1's performance was suppressed, the company is confident that it can leverage its presence in the US market to achieve better results.</p>
