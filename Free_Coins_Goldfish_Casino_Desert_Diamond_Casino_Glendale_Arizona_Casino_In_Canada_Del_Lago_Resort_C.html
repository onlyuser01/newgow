<p>PointsBet Canada is mulling on expanding operations in Alberta, attracted by the continuous diversification as a tech hub of the province and the importance of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor.</p>
<p>‘Talent and Highly-Skilled Workforce’</p>
<p>PoinstBet Canada is considering an expansion of its sports betting operations in Alberta, driven by the province’s avid sports fan base and business-friendly environment comprising of competitive tax rates and diverse workforce.</p>
<p>“Our mission since the very beginning has been to build a Canadian sportsbook, with Canadian employees, for the Canadian market. We believe that Alberta has the talent and highly-skilled workforce that can help us be at the forefront of iGaming in Canada.” Scott Vanderwel, Chief Executive Officer of PointsBet Canada</p>
<p>Unique in its capability to control the back-end of its operations by owning its technology, PointsBet proved to be competitive in the burgeoning US sports betting market among much larger-scale operators and its hands-on in-house approach creates an opportunity that allows for operations, investment and jobs to either open or remain in Alberta, where over 3,000 tech companies already set foot.</p>
<p>Vanderwel emphasized on PointsBet Canada’s commitment to the Canadian marketplace, including the creation of new jobs to serve its sports betting market that is yet to pick up speed, while using the occasion to propose to Alberta to “pursue a regulated and competitive iGaming market in the province” and take advantage of “an even greater economic opportunity” than that of the single-game sports betting.</p>
<p>“Doing so would create a level-playing field in a responsible and licensed gaming market for Alberta’s sports fans,” Vanderwel concluded.</p>
<p>In the last few months, PointsBet Canada became the exclusive sports betting partner of the NHL Alumni Association, Daily Faceoff and The Nation Network, Team Kevin Koe and Team Kerri Einarson, as well as the official partner of Curling Canada to affirm its commitment to support sports in the country.</p>
<p>‘Authentically Canadian Sportsbook’</p>
<p>Commenting on the announcement, Invest Alberta CEO Rick Christiaanse highlighted Alberta’s “competitive business environment, talent pipeline and unique infrastructure” as the main drivers that will continue to elevate the province’s status “as a growing tech hub.”</p>
<p>“Our recent MOU with PointsBet Canada will support the company on its investment journey as PointsBet looks to Alberta as a potential destination for high-impact investment,” Christiaanse added.</p>
<p>Jay Downton, Co-Founder of The Nation Network and partner of PointsBet Canada also spoke with high regard of PointsBet Canada’s intentions and commitment to “building a product” that would be true to Canadian identity and “not just paying lip-service to its customers,” hailing the operator as an “authentically Canadian sportsbook.”</p>
<p>“As a proud Edmontonian, I am excited to see them looking to Alberta to expand their operations,” Downton concluded.</p>
