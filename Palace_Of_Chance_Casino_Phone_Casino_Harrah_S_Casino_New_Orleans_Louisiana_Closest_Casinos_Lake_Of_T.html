<p>Turnock’s internal promotion follows an immensely successful year for the digital media products and services provider as its award-winning Dev division accomplished several important milestones. Turnock’s experience, leadership skills, and familiarity with Checkd’s internal procedures should translate well into his new position and help him propel the company to new heights.</p>
<p>The New Finance Director Proved His Worth</p>
<p>Sam Turnock joined Checkd in June 2019 after nearly five years as an audit senior at leading independent accountancy firm HURST Accountants. A Master’s Degree in Strategic Planning &amp; Investment at Newcastle university, followed by an ICAEW ACA qualification, gave him a stable foundation to pursue high-profile career opportunities. His appointment at Checkd allowed him to apply his knowledge and familiarize himself with the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>Starting as financial controller at Checkd Media, the company’s social marketing arm, Turnock applied his skills and earned himself the respect of his peers. He was present during the organization’s rapid rise to prominence, and efforts were instrumental in securing its CPA state licenses and ensuring the successful launch of the FlashPicks brand. A goal-oriented mindset and a successful track record make Turnock a natural choice as finance director.</p>
<p>Turnock Takes the Helm During a Dynamic Period for Checkd</p>
<p>Turnock will now head Checkd’s business intelligence area and oversee its finances across the organization’s various arms, brands, and subsidiaries. Checkd Media managing director Alex Beecham congratulated the new finance director on the promotion, lauding his analytical and data-based decision-making skills. According to Beecham, Turnock’s expertise in contract and procurement would prove invaluable in bolstering growth.</p>
<p>Sam fit the bill for us in every regard. His performance since first joining our business four years ago has been exemplary. Alex Beecham, Checkd Media managing director</p>
<p>Turnock noted that Checkd Group was the strongest it had ever been and was in a perfect position to pursue further expansion. He added that the company’s experienced team was relentlessly working towards accomplishing their long-term goals through the execution of successful business strategies across multiple regions.</p>
<p>I am incredibly proud to be taking on the role of Finance Director at a time when the Group is experiencing such dynamic growth. Sam Turnock, Checkd Group finance director</p>
<p>Checkd has maintained significant momentum in the last few months thanks to two new high-profile partnerships. In December, the organization teamed up with player acquisition and retention company Xtreme Push, bolstering its customer-facing brands on both sides of the Atlantic. Checkd Media also reached a significant milestone after an agreement to develop a new exclusive horse racing show called The Inside Track for William Hill.</p>
