    <h1>Best Usa Bitcoin Casino No Deposit Bonus Hotel Casino Monte Carlo Las Vegas Running Aces Casino Race</h1>

<p>The UK Gambling Commission has won an important distinction, Great Place to Work, distinguishing the regulator for one of the best working cultures in the UK</p>
<p>This comes at a time when the country is preparing to welcome ample changes to the gambling industry. The period has been long and fraught with a White Paper review expected to drop on Thursday, April 27 and change much about how the industry is regulated.</p>
<p>Reaffirming the UKGC’s Commitment to Consumers and Employees</p>
<p>Over the years, there have even been calls to completely overhaul the UK Gambling Commission or, in more extremist views, scrap the regulator in its current form due to its “inefficacy.” The latest distinction therefore is an important boost to the regulator’s reputation which has been busy in the past months, issuing some of the stiffest penalties on record.</p>
<p>The regulator has been praised for a number of reasons, including the watchdog’s approach to hybrid working, making full use of technology, and hosting various events and digital initiatives to bring staff closer together and improve the working environment across the board.</p>
<p>The UK Gambling Commission has also been praised for its massive data-collecting effort and the meaningful and impactful leveraging of that information as part of various internal programs and initiatives. This approach has helped the regulator considerably increase its competency and efficacy.</p>
<p>Much Hard Work Has Gone Into Securing the Distinction</p>
<p>Commenting on these achievements, UKGC chief executive Andrew Rhodes hailed the accolade and commended the hard work of all colleagues at the Commission who have made this possible. Rhodes added:</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on putting people first and doing the right thing by focusing on areas such as personal development. I’m delighted that has led to us being recognized as one of the country’s best places to work over the past 12 months. UKGC chief executive Andrew Rhodes</p>
<p>Great Place to Work did not pick the UKGC at random. The initiative performed evaluations of hundreds of workplaces, and making the shortlist is indeed a demanding process that expects companies to be on point across a range of factors. The regulator now faces a busy road ahead of it as the reregulation of the UK gambling market is on the cards.</p>
