<p>Hollywood Casino York is an approximately $120 million investment Penn National is making. It hopes to protect a key feeding market and thoroughfare for its larger Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course in Grantville. The roughly 80,000 square foot venue is replacing a former Sears department store at the York Galleria Mall.</p>
<p>Hollywood York will feature 500 slot machines and 24 table games, a race and sportsbook, a casual restaurant and bar, and a grab-and-go coffee spot. Penn National needs employees to operate the forthcoming facility and announced the opening of a career center at the mall this week.</p>
<p>Whether you prefer being at the center of it all, or working behind the scenes, there’s a role for everyone at Hollywood Casino York,” said Erin Chamberlin, senior vice president of regional operations for Penn National.</p>
<p>Penn National says Hollywood York’s permanent workforce will total around 200 positions. Persons interested in applying for a position at the casino can do so from 10:30 am to 5:30 pm at the property’s career center, located on the lower level of the mall.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Satellite Developments</p>
<p>Pennsylvania greatly expanded its gaming industry in 2017 when the Republican-controlled Assembly and Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf signed off on the Expanded Gaming Act.</p>
<p>The legislation authorized online gambling, sports betting, fantasy sports, and video gaming terminals inside certain truck stops. The package additionally created so-called “mini-casinos” or Category 4 gaming licenses that were auctioned to current casino operators and stakeholders in the state.</p>
<p>Penn National won the first auction round with a staggering $50.1 million offer. The company selected Springettsbury Township, a municipality that did not opt-out of Category 4 consideration.</p>
<p>“It was an investment we felt like we had to make to protect a major market area for our casino [at Penn National Race Course]. That cannibalization would have been, in our view, very significant,” said Eric Schippers, Penn National spokesperson, after winning the auction in early 2018.</p>
<p>Penn officials say the York casino is expected to draw customers from south-central Pennsylvania and northern Maryland. The company believes the satellite will also protect its existing market share in Grantville.</p>
<p>The $120 million York development cost is inclusive of the $50.1 million auction fee, plus a $2.5 million add-on fare for the venue to feature table games.</p>
<p>Along with York, Penn National won another Category 4 auction round in April of 2018 when it was the high bidder with just a $7.5 million bid. The company is building Hollywood Casino Morgantown along the Pennsylvania Turnpike. That satellite is expected to open this fall.</p>
<p>Casino Benefits</p>
<p>Hollywood Casino York, Penn National predicts, will generate $1 million annually in new tax revenue for Springettsbury Township.</p>
<p>Slot machines at the casino will include denominations ranging from just a penny to $100 per spin. Blackjack, craps, and roulette will initially be the offered table games.</p>
<p>Minors will not be permitted anywhere inside the casino, including the restaurant.</p>
