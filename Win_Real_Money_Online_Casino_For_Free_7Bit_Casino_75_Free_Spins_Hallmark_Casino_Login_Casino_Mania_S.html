<p>The grand prize from America's popular lottery continues to grow and is expected to hit $100 million for the drawing set for Wednesday</p>
<p>Less than two weeks have passed since a lucky winner from California hit the second-biggest jackpot from Powerball, a staggering $1.76 billion. After the jackpot prize was hit, it reset to $20 million and has been growing since. The grand prize survived the latest drawing which was on Monday after no one guessed correctly the five white balls, 18, 21, 25, 46 and 64, along with the red Powerball 21.</p>
<p>While the jackpot keeps growing it is expected to surpass $100 million for the drawing scheduled for Wednesday, October 25, 2023. With hours left until the new drawing, lottery players are likely preparing once again and hoping to win the grand prize.</p>
<p>The estimated $100 million jackpot prize can be secured by a player who correctly guesses all winning numbers and selects annual installment payments. If the lucky winner selects a lump cash sum that is also an option, but it would decrease the jackpot to approximately $43.4 million, still a life-changing sum.</p>
<p>The recent billion-dollar jackpot caught the eye of online users who questioned how is it possible for four out of the top five Powerball jackpots to drop in California. While the $1.76 billion marked the biggest prize, in November last year, again in the Sunshine State, the biggest Powerball prize dropped, a staggering $2.04 billion.</p>
<p>The Latest Drawing Sees More than 230,000 Winning Tickets</p>
<p>Mondayâ€™s drawing saw just above 230,000 winning tickets. Considering the number of winning tickets, it is likely that the billion-dollar jackpot attracted many more players. This comes in the context of having some 5.3 million winning tickets for the billion-dollar drawing, a staggering number when compared to the latest lottery draw.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, only one lucky lottery player secured a million-dollar prize from the latest drawing. Thanks to the Power Play prize, the player was able to scoop up $2 million after guessing correctly all white balls and paying extra for Power Play.</p>
<p>Five lottery players who guessed correctly four white balls and the red Powerball secured $50,000 each, while three collected a $250,000 Power Play prize from the most recent drawing.</p>
<p>Some 150 players guessed correctly four white balls, securing a $100 prize each. On the other hand, 61 lottery players guessed correctly four white balls and paid for Power Play, taking home $500 each.</p>
<p>As usual, the biggest number of winning tickets was within the lowest prize tier. Some 156,134 lottery players guessed correctly only the red Powerball, granting them a $4 prize each.</p>
