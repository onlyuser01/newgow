    <h1>Casino In Las Vegas Nv Belterra Casino Top Casinos Casino Tips Fremont Hotel Casino Las Vegas Relax</h1>

<p>The award-winning, Business-to-Business provider of multiple proprietary products including poker, bingo, and a fast-growing casino offering, Relax Gaming, has announced the launch of yet another interesting slot title with a captivating medieval theme in place and a massive win potential.</p>
<p>Joker Split hands out exciting invitations to knights of the realm to proceed to mount their horses and join them in the Middle Ages, where jokers will stand by their side as trustful allies while wild symbols will turn into their “comedy”, as explained by the provider that also launched its innovative slots with British gambling giant bet365 in February.</p>
<p>Joker Split Metrics Overview</p>
<p>Rows: 6</p>
<p>Reels: 6</p>
<p>Paylines: Cluster</p>
<p>RTP: 96.1%</p>
<p>Volatility: High</p>
<p>Bet: Min/Max Bet: 0.10/50</p>
<p>Max Win: 20,000x</p>
<p>Release date: September 5, 2023</p>
<p>Free Spins, Wild Re-Spins, and Multipliers</p>
<p>The new high-volatility game packs free spins, wild re-spins, and multipliers while giving players the opportunity to jump straight into the action and buy free spins and additional spins at the end of free spin bonus rounds.</p>
<p>To reach the maximum win of 20,000x the bet, players need to split wild re-spins along with the lucrative free spins featuring wild symbols jumping onto the reels.</p>
<p>All wilds that are part of a winning cluster will be seen jumping out of the reel, then proceeding to duplicate themselves and finally trigger a re-spin on the grid. During that respective re-spin, the wild symbols that belonged to the previous spin will return to the grid.</p>
<p>Players who manage to scoop up three to five bonus symbols on any location on the reels will trigger five to seven free spins. During the free spins round, all wilds that are not involved in forming a winning combination will get stored. During each first re-spin of every spin, all wilds will make a return onto the grid.</p>
<p>To save time and enjoy more thrills, players can buy their way into the free spins bonus round. They are also given the chance to buy additional spins at the end of free spin bonuses once the total multiplier of their stored wild symbols is less than 200x.</p>
<p>Collecting “Treasures of Old” While Journeying Through Time</p>
<p>As painted by the company’s chief product officer, Shelley Hannah, the new game carries players on a fascinating medieval “journey through time”.</p>
<p>There, they are encouraged to collect old treasures while enjoying the fascinating game mechanics and the highly lucrative bonus features.</p>
<p>The CPO of the company distinguished with the Best Game Provider at the AskGamblers Awards, Casino/Slot Developer of the Year at the SBC Awards, and Best Mobile Gaming Software Provider at the EGR B2B Awards in 2022 also referred to Joker Split as “a treasure trove of entertainment”.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, in May, Relax Gaming announced a new partnership with Trigger Studios,</p>
<p>one of the freshest gaming studios in the industry right after it added Studio 21 to Powered By Relax Platform.</p>
