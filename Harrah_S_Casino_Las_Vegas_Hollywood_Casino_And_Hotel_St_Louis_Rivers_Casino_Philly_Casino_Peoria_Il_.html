    <h1>Harrah S Casino Las Vegas Hollywood Casino And Hotel St Louis Rivers Casino Philly Casino Peoria Il</h1>

<p>The company is reportedly not ready to launch by the previously set date of March 10 which means that it will not be launching at all. MGC executive director Karen Wells said that the company is effectively withdrawing from Massachusetts because of missing that date.</p>
<p>PointsBet Bows Out of Massachusetts Online Betting Race</p>
<p>This means that there are a total of 10 sports betting mobile apps that are readying to launch before long, although not all will be coming on time for March madness this year. Betway, for example, is confirmed for a launch in 2024, and Bally Bet and Fanatics Sportsbook are expected to arrive in May this year.</p>
<p>DraftKings, FanDuel, Betr, Barstool Sportsbook, WynnBET, Caesars Sportsbook, and BetMGM should go online with the official launch date on March 10, when the Bay State is giving the go-ahead to its online betting industry. PointsBet will miss out on this launch, and not launch in what could have been a 14th state for the company.</p>
<p>PointsBet’s most recent entry was in Ohio this January, and in Maryland before that in November. The company’s decision to bow out of the race in the Bay State is definitely a surprise as PointsBet has been very much determined to grow its footprint and go head-to-head with some of the biggest companies from the sector.</p>
<p>PointsBet could have made the decision to not compete in Massachusetts, acknowledging that the retail competition is too concentrated and that certain companies that run the land-based properties would be able to offer better and stronger incentives to customers to try their retail options, through loyalty and other marketing stratagems. Whatever the decision is, we won’t be seeing PointsBet come live on time for the online betting launch.</p>
