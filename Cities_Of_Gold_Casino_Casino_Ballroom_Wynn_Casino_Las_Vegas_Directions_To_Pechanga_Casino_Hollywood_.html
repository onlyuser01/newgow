<p>A new partnership with Boldt Group sees GiG power its brand's launch into the regulated gambling market in the province</p>
<p>The leading iGaming technology provider delivering solutions, services and products to the growing online gambling industry, Gaming Innovation Group (GiG), announced a new collaboration, allowing it to further expand its global footprint. The company revealed that it signed a new collaboration with Boldt Group.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the freshly minted partnership, GiG agreed to power the operator’s popular Bplay brand. As a result, GiG’s platform is now live within the market in Mendoza, Argentina, after the launch of Bplay.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new collaboration, Bplay, which is already a recognized local brand for the market in Argentina, will continue growing. The recent launch within the province further expands the brand’s reach after successful launches in the City of Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Entre Rios, as well as Santa Fe.</p>
<p>The latest deal helps expand the partnership between GiG and Boldt Group, which is a leading online and retail gambling operator in Latin America. In fact, by teaming up with GiG, the company was able to significantly expand the presence of Bplay within Argentina. Between May 2022 and May 2023, the brand has seen its GGR multiply by more than four times, reaffirming the potential, scalability and benefits GiG’s leading technology brings. Besides the latest collaboration, the duo is expected to further elevate their deal by introducing a sportsbook for Bplay within the market in Mendoza at some point during the third quarter.</p>
<p>The Brand Continues to Expand Thanks to GiG</p>
<p>José del Pino, Grupo Boldt’s business unit manager, was excited about the new collaboration with GiG. He spoke about the growth of the Bplay brand within Latin America and acknowledged that it continues to deliver new products that boost fan engagement.</p>
<p>“Bplay continues to provide the best gaming experience for our clients in Latin America, leading not only in the launch of new licenses, incorporating new and great games and products, but also improving user satisfaction.“ José del Pino, business unit manager of Grupo Boldt</p>
<p>The new collaboration sees GiG continue to expand its leading solutions. By now, the company has a presence in 30 regulated gambling markets around the world, while it also remains focused on expanding further with engaging brands such as Bplay.</p>
<p>“Our excellent relationship with the Boldt Group and the continuing expansion of our original deal, highlights the strength of our Platform, technology and managed services teams.“ David Bonnefous Saavedra, commercial director at GiG</p>
<p>David Bonnefous Saavedra, GiG’s commercial director, spoke about the scalability and strength of the company’s platform and services. He explained that the successful business relationship with Boldt Group is a testament to the effectiveness of GiG’s technology. Finally, Saavedra predicted that the collaboration with Bplay helps GiG continue to grow its leadership position as a top business-to-business technology provider.</p>
