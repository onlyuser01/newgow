<p>Fox Sports is shifting towards sports betting-oriented audiences in Mexico and announced the upcoming launch of its new sports betting program, Money Line Show.</p>
<p>Engage with Sports Betting Audiences</p>
<p>Money Line Show, a new program aimed at viewers with interest not only in sports but in sports wagering will be launched by Fox Sports Mexico on May 16 and will air Monday through Friday as the operator is looking to boost interest in sports betting in the country.</p>
<p>“It’s a format that seeks to unite the world of betting with the world of sport, without forgetting that betting must be done responsibly,” said Joshúa Maya, Betting Expert and Presenter of the Money Line Show.</p>
<p>Besides Maya, the new Fox Sports Mexico program will feature other experts in sports and sports betting such as Alex Blanco, Silvia Gómez, Mónica Arredondo, Mariana Velázquez de León, and Jack Ades and will look to respond to the growing interest in sports betting in Mexico where gambling is still stigmatized despite being completely legal.</p>
<p>“Until a few years ago, all betting was illegal, but nowadays there are formal bookmakers and the sport is becoming more and more structured, which has allowed more and more sponsors of this type to appear on club uniforms as well as during football broadcasts.” Jack Ades, Betting and Hosting Expert, Money Line Show</p>
<p>As Mexico is gradually shaking off the taboo of sports betting, Fox Sports believes the market holds significant potential for growth and its Money Line Show will look to engage with audiences by explaining how sports betting works and what are the different betting concepts within the industry.</p>
<p>“The world of betting has grown significantly, between 2020 to date there has been a 30% increase in this sector; in addition, it is expected that by 2025 the growth will be 50% compared to 2020, which is why today it is considered one of the most important industries in the world that grows the most.” Joshua Maya, Presenter, Money Line Show</p>
<p>The new sports betting show will not only look to educate the public on the merits of sports betting and responsible gaming, but will also provide them with an opportunity to leverage the experience and expertise of the show presenters and potentially earn extra money from sports betting.</p>
<p>The new Fox Sports Mexico show appears to be a continuation of a similar sports betting program aired last July as an exclusive podcast on Futvox and called El Money Line Show. Joshua Maya was one of the hosts of the podcast.</p>
