    <h1>Casino Del Sol Restaurants Hotel Excalibur Hotel Casino Casino Site Hotel Casino Monte Carlo Las Veg</h1>

<p>I have tried.. and I can‚Äôt üôÅ it doesn‚Äôt seem possible, no lawyer wants to hear it. I‚Äôve lost over $300,000 to 2 Crypto casinos in 6 months. The most powerful addiction with no limit or no one to help control your deposits. Online slots can be very dangerous - Trainwreck, Roshtein, Ayezee, Foss are all my influences. I guess that‚Äôs why they're literally called "social media influencers" they broadcast to an audience that eventually try to mimic what they see.</p>
<p>Not one of these streamers feels a "loosing day" like an actual gambler with no affiliation, that doesn‚Äôt get paid to play, but actually works a job and it starts as fun, because it is fun, and can be a fun hobby if play is responsible- after all it‚Äôs an overload to the brain</p>
<p>I‚Äôve attempted suicide over my recent loss as it wasn‚Äôt just a financial loss but the trust of my family. After giving them control of everything for almost 3 months I ordered a new ledger, and switched the device they held and stole my crypto back in order to gamble. Thought I had control and deposit after deposit lost everything I have ever had this same night. Casino let me down I asked them for a loan of $2000 to play and they never shut my account or raised concern about problem playing the very next day I lost $160,000 in 5 hours depositing 13 times</p>
<p>Twitch ignore literally every and any request to monitor/ refuse to give strikes to slot stream abuse even when the streamers are some of the biggest streamers on the platform.</p>
<p>trainwreckstv streams slots under the "Just Chatting" section, against the r</p>
<p>Twitch‚Äôs lack of rules against showing slot gambling (and yes, I will admit my own stupidity / mental health) have ultimately led me to the state of how my life is now.</p>
<p>I had never bought a scratch card or gambled before watching these streamers and seeing them turn $100,000 to a million on an almost daily basis.</p>
<p>(Radka I apologise for the rant. I‚Äôm having self control issues and venting seems to help me not take loans and make deposits. Please feel free to delete this if it doesn‚Äôt fit in the thread - I started getting carried away with venting admittedly)</p>
<p>TL;DR ;- Find me a lawyer (with good reputation and willing to go up against Twitch‚Äôs terms and conditions for personal damages) and I‚Äôll give you a finder fee.</p>
<p>Twitch doesn‚Äôt do anything against slot streamers going against their rules.</p>
<p>Ive lost over $300,000, my house, my wife and my kids. Relationship with family fell apart due to trust issues from me trying to imitate what I used to watch on stream daily before coming to the realisation what they‚Äôre promoting isn‚Äôt how casino games play or operate You won‚Äôt win, you won‚Äôt break even you will loose everything in the famous words of trainwreckstv</p>
<p>I bet (pun intended) not a single person reads the entire 2900 words post lol but I needed it off my chest tonight</p>
