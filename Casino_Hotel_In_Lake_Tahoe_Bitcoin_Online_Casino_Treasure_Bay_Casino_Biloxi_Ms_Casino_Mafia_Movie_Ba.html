    <h1>Casino Hotel In Lake Tahoe Bitcoin Online Casino Treasure Bay Casino Biloxi Ms Casino Mafia Movie Ba</h1>

<p>Pragmatic Play, one of the world’s leading suppliers of slot, table games, and live casino content, has signed a new partnership with World Sports Betting in South Africa, allowing the developer to expand its footprint in the market while bolstering the operator’s own diversity and appeal to local players.</p>
<p>Under the new content partnership, Pragmatic Play will have the opportunity to deploy a number of its leading and player-favorite games, to name Striking Hot 5, Happy Hooves, and Sweet Bonanza. Pragmatic Play is releasing a number of additional games as well to help improve the overall variety at World Sports Betting in the strategically crucial South African market.</p>
<p>South Africa has a solid appeal to new and existing operators and suppliers, as numerous companies have launched over the years. 10bet, a brand established in 2003, said earlier this week that is also launching in the country. Betfred acquired a majority stake in LottoStar, a local operator, in June. The latest partnership between Pragmatic Play and World Sports Betting is a direct result from the building up of interest in the market.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play will make a number of its live casino titles available in the market, including its blackjack and roulette games, along with Boom City, a brand-new form of entertainment developed by the company to appeal to consumers in different markets and create more immersive experiences. Pragmatic Play COO Irina Cornides hailed this opportunity for the supplier to be breaking ground in South Africa and the African market and said:</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to be partnering with World Sports Betting and to deliver multiple verticals to their player base through this agreement. We are very excited to see the reception our content receives from players."</p>
<p>World Sports Betting CEO Warren Tannous was pleased with the news that Pragmatic Play will now power the company’s content, or rather add to its existing offer. Pragmatic, Tannous noted, was in a league of its own and therefore a vital content partner for the operator.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play is no stranger to the South African market, and it has in the past established content partnerships in the country. In April this year, Pragmatic Play teamed up with Hollywood Bets. Pragmatic Play continues to scale its global content reach with numerous partnerships across a number of continents.</p>
