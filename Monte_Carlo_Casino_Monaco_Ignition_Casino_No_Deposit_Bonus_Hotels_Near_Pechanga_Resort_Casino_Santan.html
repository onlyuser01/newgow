    <h1>Monte Carlo Casino Monaco Ignition Casino No Deposit Bonus Hotels Near Pechanga Resort Casino Santan</h1>

<p>Dear Karin66,</p>
<p>Thank you for your emails, and I am sorry for the delayed response.</p>
<p>Regarding my previous reply, it was an automatically generated reply by our system, and you can consider it irrelevant. It happens when you only send emails and do not reply directly in this thread. You can see that the timer has been set for casino.guru since you replied here.</p>
<p>As for your issue - although you sent the documents to the casinos again, they still do not have to meet the casino's requirements. Some of those documents are not clear/partially blurry or unreadable. Moreover, the casino gave you clear instructions for the bank card that needs to be additionally verified. Although now there is the whole card number in the photo, and it could be likely accepted, you did not cover up the correct part(s) on it again.</p>
<p>However, if there are any inconsistencies in the provided documents, the casino has the right to ask you for additional documents/verification at any time. That is industry standard, and I strongly recommend you provide the casino(s) with the requested documents. Otherwise, we cannot move forward, and there is nothing more we could help you with in resolving your issue.</p>
<p>After reviewing your lastly sent documents, I recommend you ask someone around with a better mobile phone and camera (or simply a camera) to take the needed photos in better quality and follow the casino's instructions. All requirements have to be met - covering the correct numbers/parts of the documents, all ID/card corners have to be visible on the photos, and everything has to be clear and readable. For example, you can try to check the quality of a document by zooming it in - if, after multiple zooms, it is not possible to clearly read the personal details on the documents, the quality is low.</p>
<p>Also, if the casino needs to make a call, it is a part of the verification process. Therefore, I am afraid you will have to agree on a call with a casino representative and make it.</p>
<p>Dear Thunderbolt Casino Team,</p>
<p>I am not sure if I received a complete communication, but from the data provided by the player, I see that the call should have been made on December 19, 2022, not on December 20, 2022.</p>
<p>You stated that there is an outstanding unresolved issue at one of your sister casinos. To finally move somewhere with the player's issue, could you please provide us with the information in what casino(s) this issue occurred, whether it has been already resolved, and if not, what is needed to be done on the player's side to resolve it? Is there any update on the mentioned issue in the casino(s) in question?</p>
<p>If it is more convenient for you, feel free to provide me with a reply to my email (branislav.b@casino.guru).</p>
