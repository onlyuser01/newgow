<p>America’s largest gaming company and worldwide leader in hospitality Caesars Entertainment Inc has signed a multi-year deal with the New York Mets. According to the agreement, Caesars Sportsbook will turn into the Major League Baseball franchise’s official partner for sports betting.</p>
<p>The New Partnership Follows Caesars’ Goal to Become a Market Leader</p>
<p>After the official launch of its mobile app on the New York sports betting market on January 8, Caesars Sportsbook has crowned the ruler of the market after just a few brief weeks of operation. According to official revenue data from the New York State Gaming Commission released on January 21, Caesars New York managed to raise on top of the other four mobile sports betting operators in the Empire State.</p>
<p>The app gathered an impressive handle of close to $258 million, which propelled it to the highest position for gross gaming revenue in the state. Caesars Digital’s co-president Chris Holdren made it clear that the company’s main goal was focused on perfecting the sports betting experience for New Yorkers.</p>
<p>Since powerful partnerships with top names are a must for attracting a big crowd and building trust, Caesars Sportsbook chose to partner with several prestigious teams and associations in the state. The list includes names like the New York Rangers, Madison Square Garden, the Buffalo Bills, the Knicks, and the New York Racing Association. In a desire to keep growing and offering unparalleled sports betting experiences to the people of New York, Caesar’s has now decided to invite the New York Mets to join its premier list of partners.</p>
<p>The new deal will help Caesars Sportsbook significantly grow its presence and visibility in the area by broadcasting and creating digital content across a variety of properties belonging to the team.</p>
<p>What Will the New Partnership Mean for Sports Bettors?</p>
<p>Besides the rich plethora of incredible VIP experiences topped by hospitality assets that Caesars Rewards members will benefit from, the new deal will also bring fans a sportsbook lounge at Citi Field. The newly redesigned lounge will be called Caesars Sportsbook at the Metro Grille and its grand opening is expected to happen sometime during the 2022 Major League Baseball season.</p>
<p>The season will end at the beginning of October. In the meanwhile, it is expected to attract a large number of baseball fans in the 13,000 square feet on the Excelsior Level at the Citi Field location. The new lounge will bring in sports aficionados eager to try the complex dining experience in the multi-tiered dining hall, or relax on the spectacular outdoor patio with panoramic views over the left field.</p>
<p>The partnership will also bring Caesars Sportsbook unrestricted access to the official New York Mets marks and logos, as well as in-game signage that will be visible on TV. Co-president Holdren called New York “a key state” for the company while describing the New York Mets’ fanbase as “one of the most loyal in baseball ” who deserve to receive the Caesar treatment. Last November, New York Mets’ owner Steve Cohen brought up a potential casino opening next to Citi Field in collaboration with Las Vegas Sands Corp.</p>
