<p>UK-and Canada-based HTML5 casino game design, creation, and distribution studio HungryBear Gaming has signed a historic agreement with NASDAQ-listed Light &amp; Wonder, Inc. subsidiary Light &amp; Wonder. According to the terms of the agreement, the latter will integrate and distribute the provider’s pioneer multiplayer game, Slot Masters. The game will become available across Light &amp; Wonder’s expanded network which consists of hundreds of global operators.</p>
<p>Slot Masters, Available Via the OPENGAMING Platform</p>
<p>The new slot game, which is a free-to-play title, has been incorporated into Light &amp; Wonder’s state-of-the-art OPENGAMING platform. This means the three-way game that allows players to control the score of their opponents with a series of weapons used for attacks and defense will grow even more in popularity by reaching a much wider audience.</p>
<p>HungryBear Gaming’s chief executive officer and founder Justin Chamberlin called the new deal “a game-changer” while expressing delight to be shaking hands with “one of the leading names” in the iGaming industry. Up until now, the game has been directly integrated with individual operators. Now, thanks to the terms of the new deal, Slot Masters will become available via Light &amp; Wonder’s platform, opening the door “to an enormous array of global brands.” These brands will be able to integrate the existing multiplayer slot in a seamless manner while enjoying the benefits of offering one of the most exciting games on the market.</p>
<p>So far, a number of premier brands including Jackpot Joy, RAINBOW RCHES CASINO, Virgin, Ladbrokes, Foxy Bingo, and Megaways Casino have all embraced the game. When the game went live with Entain’s brands Foxy Bingo and Ladbrokes, Chamberlain called it “a dream come true.”</p>
<p>Just three months after its official launch tournaments were introduced to players, the game managed to record a massive growth in popularity. Official statistics showed the game was played more than 500,000 times while recording over 32 million spins. SlotMasters has therefore become a “staple part of operators’ offerings,” making the new distribution deal with Light &amp; Wonder even more desirable for both parties.</p>
<p>Bespoke Advertising Campaigns</p>
<p>The game will launch across several European operators as well as operators located in other parts of the world in the upcoming weeks and months. A few brands will also release a series of custom TV and online advertising campaigns. To make the slot even more visible and easy to spot, operators will also incorporate it within their homepage tabs.</p>
<p>HungryBear Gaming is also close to finishing its first real-money alternative to the “ground-breaking” game, as defined by Light &amp; Wonder’s vice president of game development Robert Procter. An official release date will be announced prior to the end of the year.Last week, Light &amp; Wonder published its third-quarter results, highlighting a strong quarter a 20% growth in revenue to $648 million.</p>
