<p>State Rep. Andy Whitt confirmed his plans to introduce new proposal that plans to implement blanket penalties for people involved in illegal gambling</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is a growing concern for Alabama. While lawmakers’ efforts to legalize gambling continue, valuable tax revenue is flowing to nearby states or worse, benefits the illegal gambling sector. State Rep. Andy Whitt is among the lawmakers who support changes to Alabama’s regulations, and he recently unveiled plans for a new bill that seeks to repeal the illegal gambling sector in the state.</p>
<p>As announced by WSFA, Whitt has been actively engaged in the issue and has so far visited 45 illegal gambling venues across the state together with law enforcement. He supported the idea for the development of a robust framework for legal gambling in Alabama.</p>
<p>Such legislation, Whitt said, needs to tackle illegal gambling. He confirmed his plans for a new bill that would result in “blanket penalties” for anyone involved in illegal gambling activities.</p>
<p>Moreover, Whitt spoke about the growing threat of the black market, explaining that illegal gambling boosts other criminal activities like drug use or violent crimes. “You name it, it’s probably there in those casinos. And we need to make sure that we work to get that cleaned up,” he said.</p>
<p>While the debate on gaming legalization continues, earlier this month, Whitt once again warned about the dangers illegal gaming operators pose. “When a person can walk into a convenience store that is only a few blocks from our State’s Capitol and purchase a scratch-off ticket, then yeah, we have a big problem,” he said at the time.</p>
<p>Still, it is yet to be confirmed when Whitt’s proposal will be up for debate. It is likely Alabama lawmakers to pick up this topic during the upcoming regular legislative season.</p>
<p>Legal Gambling to Bring Benefits to Alabama</p>
<p>Besides tax revenue flowing out of state, illegal gambling poses a threat for the customers as well. This is because black market operators are not required to comply with responsible gambling tools or even self-exclusion. As a result, people addicted to gambling can spend thousands of dollars or accumulate significant debt.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, another supporter of gambling legalization in Alabama, confirmed earlier this month that the regulated gambling sector can bring significant financial benefits. According to him, those proceeds can provide vital funding for communities as well as different public programs.</p>
<p>Ledbetter has been supporting the legalization of gambling for a few years. He previously confirmed that many residents of the state already participate in gambling, suggesting that a legal sector can also help protect gamblers from different criminal activities related to the illegal gaming sector.</p>
