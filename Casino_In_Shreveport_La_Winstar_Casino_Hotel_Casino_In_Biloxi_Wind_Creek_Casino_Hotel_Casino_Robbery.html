    <h1>Casino In Shreveport La Winstar Casino Hotel Casino In Biloxi Wind Creek Casino Hotel Casino Robbery</h1>

<p>The New Jersey Devils have signed a multi-year partnership with Betway, a global sports betting and gaming brand, last Friday. The partnership will allow the companies to benefit from each other’s brand awareness and likeness to drive stronger engagement with sports fans around the world and in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Betway will receive exposure and TV signage that will be introduced to Newark’s Prudential Center during the Devils home games. The signage will feature Zamboni tunnel and in-bowl staircase branding, ensuring that the Betway name and logo stay in fans’ eyes during each game.</p>
<p>There will be LED rings and scoreboard advertising to further establish the company’s footprint. Betway is also bringing original content tailored to the Devils. As a result, the “Devils Starting Line-Up presented by Betway” series of social posts will be shared across New Jersey Devils’ own social media channels.</p>
<p>Firm Opportunity for Both Entities in a Growing Market</p>
<p>Commenting on this partnership, Betway CEO Anthony Werkman confirmed that the company was thrilled to be striking this alliance. Werkman added:</p>
<p>“Our partnership with the Devils will give us great exposure via the extensive list of marketing rights, which will enable us to showcase our products to customers in New Jersey.” Betway CEO Anthony Werkman</p>
<p>The news was well-received by Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment SVP of global partnerships Adam Cross, who said that New Jersey punters are some of the savviest in the country. They are constantly aware of new sports betting opportunities, and the team is happy to be introducing Devils audiences to Betway’s advanced and unique platform.</p>
<p>“The New Jersey sports fan continues to be savvy, aware and engaged with sports betting opportunities; and we are pleased to introduce them to Betway’s unique platform, featuring some of the most entertaining wagers and competitive odds available today.” New Jersey Devils SVP of global partnerships Adam Cross</p>
<p>New Jersey managed to clock in $1.3 billion in monthly sports handle results for October, making it the biggest in the US. This is not the first time the Devils have teamed up with a gaming company.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the team struck a partnership with PlayUp, another established betting company in the Garden State. Betway has been present across numerous sports franchises and leagues in the US of late. The brand has active partnerships with the Miami Heat, the Philadelphia 76ers, and the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>
