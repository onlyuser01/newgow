    <h1>Harrahs Casino Chester Las Vegas Hotel Casinos Restaurants In Ocean Casino Salt Creek Casino Gardens</h1>

<p>Dear Casino Guru team,</p>
<p>On March 24 the player has claimed our exclusive deposit bonus of 200% for his deposit of 25 EUR.</p>
<p>According to our Bonus terms, the maximum winnings that will be paid out resulting from a bonus or free spins (or combination of bonus and free spins) for deposit will be equal to 10 (ten) deposits made to participate in a particular campaign. Any winnings exceeding the limit will be forfeited.</p>
<p>When the player placed a withdrawal request of 300 EUR after the review of the player's account our payment department adjusted the player's balance to the maximum possible winnings amount of 250 EUR and informed the player that he also needs to verify his account to be able to withdraw his winnings.</p>
<p>The player continued to play with his real balance and used all his funds in games normally.</p>
<p>The player can review his gaming history under his profile in the My History section. He can also download his playing history in Excel or CSV file.</p>
<p>Reviewing this complaint we didn't find any issue with the player's balance. And correction of the winnings was made accordingly to our Bonus Terms which can be found here:</p>

If he still has an issue reviewing his playing account history he is very welcome to contact our support team for help.</p>
