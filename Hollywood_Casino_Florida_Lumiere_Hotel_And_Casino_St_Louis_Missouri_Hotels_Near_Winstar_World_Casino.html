<p>As a result, Pragmatic Play will provide its array of excellent games with one of the world’s most popular iGaming brands, bet365. The regulated market in Ontario has been a stomping ground for many prominent brands, amongst which bet365 and Pragmatic Play both, which will now further benefit from this tie-up to expand their local presence.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play Makes Second Move in North American Market</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play will specifically deploy its Live Casino games, including Sweet Bonanza CandyLand and PowerUP Roulette. This expands on the supplier’s reach in the market, previously negotiated with NorthStar Gaming, another prominent operator of casino brands in the province.</p>
<p>The collaboration, therefore, marks the second tie-up Pragmatic Play has been able to negotiate in Ontario and North America in general, as the supplier seeks to expand its local presence and ensure that it remains a prominent part of the fast-expanding iGaming regulated landscape of the region. Commenting on this opportunity, Pragmatic Play chief operating officer Irina Cornides said:</p>
<p>Partnering with bet365 in Ontario is an exciting move for us at Pragmatic Play, as we continue to expand our reach in regulated markets across the world. Irina Cornides, COO, Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>Cornides said that the company was very happy to be teaming up with bet365 to further strengthen its presence in the North American market and consolidate its expansion in what is one of the most promising iGaming regions. Pragmatic Play is similarly happy to be bringing its virtual sports and live casino products to yet another operator in Ontario.</p>
<p>Bet365 Is Happy to Welcome Live Casino Products by Pragmatic Play</p>
<p>Bet365 was similarly pleased with the development. The company said that it is very happy to see Pragmatic Play join the operator with its quality games and provide players with brand-new products to try. “Their combination of award-winning innovative slots and live games perfectly fit bet365’s Games product, and they will be a welcome addition for our Ontario customers,” a spokesperson for the operator said.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Play has been making decisive strides in multiple regions and locales around the world. The company recently teamed up with Vívelo24 to further consolidate its footprint in the Latin American region. The company similarly negotiated a content partnership with 10Bet in South Africa, to boost its position in the evolving landscape of regulated African iGaming.</p>
