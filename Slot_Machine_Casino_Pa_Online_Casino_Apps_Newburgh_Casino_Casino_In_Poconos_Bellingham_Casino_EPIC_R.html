<p>Problem gambling awareness and harm minimization consultancy, EPIC Risk Management, announced its first partnership within the horse racing industry. The consultancy revealed Wednesday that it joined forces with the registered charity supporting the workforce of British horseracing, Racing Welfare.</p>
<p>Racing Welfare Names EPIC Safer Gambling Education Partner</p>
<p>Under the terms of the new collaboration, EPIC was named the charity’s Safer Gambling Education Partner. Thanks to the new deal, the duo will seek to raise awareness of gambling harm. Ultimately, EPIC’s goal in collaboration with Racing Welfare would be to prevent gambling-related harm as well.</p>
<p>By becoming a Safer Gambling Education partner of Racing Welfare, EPIC will introduce workshops via its leading program featuring discussions with people with lived experience of problem gambling. As a result, EPIC’s gambling education program will be added to the portfolio of support services offered by Racing Welfare. This marks a major step for the racing industry and will help raise awareness and provide invaluable support for individuals who need it. With that in mind, the recent announcement comes amid the Safer Gambling Week that started Monday and will run through Sunday.</p>
<p>Although this is EPIC’s first partner in the racing industry, the organization has already joined forces with other leading sports organizations including the English Football League (EFL), the Rugby Players’ Association (RPA), the Professional Cricketer’s Association (PCA), as well as Arsenal FC, Chelsea FC, Manchester City FC. EPIC also has existing deals in the US with the NCAA and the NFLPA Professional Athletes Foundation.</p>
<p>The Collaboration Brings Excitement for Racing Welfare, EPIC</p>
<p>EPIC Risk Management’s director of sports partnerships, Ben McGregor, revealed that joining forces with Racing Welfare for the new partnership brings excitement. At the same time, he said that although this is EPIC’s first such deal within the horseracing sport, it will not be the last.</p>
<p>“We’re delighted to announce this pioneering partnership with Racing Welfare, our first foray into the sport of horse racing and certainly not our last.“ Ben McGregor, director of sports partnerships at EPIC Risk Management</p>
<p>McGregor explained that the organization’s leading education and prevention program is boosted by members of the team with lived experiences. Last but not least, he said that EPIC is looking forward to collaborating with Racing Welfare to reduce gambling harm within the sport.</p>
<p>“Helping individuals struggling with addiction is a key part of the day-to-day work that we do here at Racing Welfare, as has been the case for many years.“ Simone Sear, director at Racing Welfare</p>
<p>Simone Sear, Racing Welfare’s director, added that one of the day-to-day duties of the charity is to help people struggling with addiction. She pointed out that gambling addiction can be present in combination with other addictions such as substance abuse or in some cases mental health issues. Sear acknowledged that education is a key step in helping people cope with addictions.</p>
