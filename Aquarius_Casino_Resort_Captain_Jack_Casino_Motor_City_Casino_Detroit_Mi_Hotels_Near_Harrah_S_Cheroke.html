    <h1>Aquarius Casino Resort Captain Jack Casino Motor City Casino Detroit Mi Hotels Near Harrah S Cheroke</h1>

<p>Dear Palm Slots Team,</p>
<p>I have already described my case in the chat and have now decided to file a complaint because my patience is at an end:</p>
<p>On 12/06/22 I won the 5000 EURO jackpot in the game "King of the Jungle - Golden Nights Bonus". From the start, the win was only visible in the game itself, not in any other game and not in my account. I went into the chat, described the problem and uploaded screenshots when requested. After 3 days without a response from the casino, I wrote an email to support and received neither a confirmation of receipt nor an answer. I sent numerous reminders as a result, almost daily. At the same time, I was in the chat several times and was always put off. On November 27th, after 3 weeks (!), the casino informed me by email that the problem had been solved and that I could close the open games in the game. I couldn't remember having any. But OK. When the game was called up, the credit was 5000 euros, but not in the account. After the games ended, the balance was ZERO again. I send on 27.11. so again screenshots to the casino and explain that the problem is apparently not solved. On 11/30 I get the same answer via email that I already had, namely that I should close the games and send screenshots and what browser I'm using. Quite annoyed, I reply that I had already done that and that there were no games to finish and I send all the screenshots again. I call the browser once again (Firefox). After talking to CasinoGuru in chat, Radka advises me to shoot a video to show that there are no open games. Thank you again! So I'll shoot a video and email it to PalmSlots on 12/2/22 at 2:07pm. On 03., 04. and 05.12. I send reminder emails and set a deadline until yesterday, December 5th. If the 5000 EURO is not credited to my account by then, I would file a complaint with CasinoGuru, which I hereby do.</p>
<p>Additional info: Since I couldn't upload the screenshots, I converted them into pdf's and uploaded them. Unfortunately I could not upload the video here due to the file size. I'll be happy to send it another way if that's possible. I can also send the screenshots in jpg format if necessary.</p>
<p>Many thanks for your help!</p>
<p>Many greetings</p>
<p>Eveline R<strong><em>*</em></strong>*</p>
