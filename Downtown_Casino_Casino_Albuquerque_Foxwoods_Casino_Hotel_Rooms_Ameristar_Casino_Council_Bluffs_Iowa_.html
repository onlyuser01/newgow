<p>New Yorker Pedro Montanez has won $225,470 with a $90 bet on the Land O’ Loot LuckyTap game at the Tipico Casino in New Jersey</p>
<p>Every serious gambler envisions what it would be like to hit that big, life-changing win or scoop up the ultimate pot that could change their life one day.</p>
<p>While some players are still daydreaming about it, New Yorker Pedro Montanez has seen it turn into a palpable reality.</p>
<p>On November 22, the NY native wagered $90 on the Land O’ Loot LuckyTap game at the Tipico Casino online in New Jersey and scooped up a payout of no less than $225,470.</p>
<p>The amount marked the largest payout to be paid to any US bettor at Tipico Casino or Tipico Sportsbook to date.</p>
<p>Montanez Helped His Family and Made Long-Term Investments</p>
<p>Explaining what he did with the money during a press conference that celebrated his win, the lucky winner said that he provided for his family while also planning his future with a series of long-term investments.</p>
<p>He also stated that, despite the very lucky hit, he will keep on playing on Tipico, “drawn in by the easy discovery of new games.”</p>
<p>He further praised the “rich experience and opportunities” provided by the same online casino, which were additional reasons why he plans on returning there, besides the opportunity to win big.</p>
<p>Montanez also spoke about his interest in casino games that have been going on “for quite some time” further saying that Tipico stands out thanks to the quick, seamless selections that perfectly match his mood.</p>
<p>The winner compared Tipico with other platforms and said that he enjoyed the former’s versatile selection of games that guarantee each new login will trigger a one-of-a-kind gaming experience.</p>
<p>Tipico Relaunched Its Online Casino Platform in New Jersey</p>
<p>The news of the big win comes in the context of Tipico announcing the fresh relaunch of its leading industry-ranked online casino venue in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The casino counts 707 games available on desktop and mobile Android players and 441 games for mobile iOS players.</p>
<p>The casino relies on real-time data insights to fully customize the content offered to players, this way catering to their individual needs and preferences.</p>
<p>The venue has been named the top mobile casino in the US by Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming, despite its modest market share surpassing 31 other iconic brands like FanDuel and BetMGM.</p>
<p>According to Tipico US’ chief executive officer, Adrian Vella, their product “helps expedite the real money deposit and withdrawal process, providing a safe, secure experience.”</p>
<p>At the start of December, NeoGames’ Pariplay announced it would inject its gaming content into Tipico in New Jersey.</p>
