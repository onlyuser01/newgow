<p>WynnBet, the sports betting brand of Wynn Resorts, announced today it entered into a new partnership with a professional sports franchise in the US to continue its expansion across regulated jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Teaming with the Reds</p>
<p>WynnBet signed an agreement with the Cincinnati Reds from Major League Baseball (MLB) to collaborate with the franchise on marketing efforts for the current 2021 season in the professional baseball league to let fans of the Reds get acquainted with the brand and continue its brand awareness in Ohio.</p>
<p>Under the corporate partnership deal, WynnBet will gain access to official marks and logos of the Reds to utilize them for its online products, and the right to create exclusive co-branded promotional offers for sports bettors. As part of the promotions, WynnBet will offer sports fans the chance to win tickets for the Reds and team memorabilia.</p>
<p>Available for both iOS and Android mobile systems, the WynnBet app leverages all the brand experience of its parent company Wynn Resorts to offer an ultra-intuitive and highly responsive interface and provide hundreds of sports betting markets to satisfy the tastes of seasoned sports bettors and beginners alike.</p>
<p>WynnBet Continues to Gain Popularity</p>
<p>The corporate partnership deal agreed with the Reds is the latest in a series of strategic agreements WynnBet reached with sports franchises and organizations to boost its brand awareness.</p>
<p>The sports betting brand which was named an Authorized Gaming Operator of NASCAR and the Official Online Sportsbook of the Martinsville Speedway and Richmond Raceway, signed in March and May partnership deals with two franchises from the National Basketball Association (NBA), Detroit Pistons and the Memphis Grizzlies.</p>
<p>In March, WynnBet teamed with the Pistons to provide new experiences for sports fans and in May, the brand revealed a similar agreement with the Grizzlies ahead of its launch in Tennessee.</p>
<p>Following the acquisition of technology supplier BetBull in 2020, WynnBet delivers highly social sports-betting technology and unique experiences to make wagering a shared and celebrated event.</p>
