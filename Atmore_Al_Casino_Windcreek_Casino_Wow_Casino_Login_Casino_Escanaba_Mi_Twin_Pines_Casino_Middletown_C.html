<p>NetEnt has released its latest addition to the live portfolio, the Network Branded Casino (NBC). The solution focuses on enhanced live dealer games experience.</p>
<p>Network Branded Casino Arrives on NetEnt’s Live Network</p>
<p>Leading developer of casino games NetEnt has released the Network Branded Casino (NBC), a new product that improves on the existing live offer. The Swedish vendor has focused on creating a new type of customizable live experience.</p>
<p>Moving forward, players experiencing the NBC will be able to change the backgrounds and have a more immersive overall experience in the company of professional and personable live dealers.</p>
<p>The company has developed two separate rooms, featuring a select number of games. The first room is focused on standard and VIP blackjack experience. The second one includes roulette and Common Draw Blackjack by the company.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Andres Rengifo, head of NetEnt Live had this to say:</p>
<p>“The Network Branded Casino from NetEnt Live has a range of quality solutions that suit all types of operators and their objectives.” Mr. Rengifo added that their new product is “fully attuned” to operator’s needs, “allowing them to benefit from a state-of-the-art live casino product and prioritize what is most important to their brand through new levels of flexibility.”</p>
<p>NetEnt Focuses on the Live Experience</p>
<p>NetEnt has had a live casino since 2013 when the company debuted its live offer for the first time. Since that time, the company has been trying to catch up to Evolution Gaming. Recently, NetEnt released Perfect Blackjack, offering a 99.5% return – one of the highest on the market.</p>
<p>The product was developed for the needs of Grosvenor Casinos (The Rank Group), a famed operator of gambling portals. Grosvenor contributed in the game-development process as well. A little earlier this year, players had a chance to play Perfect Blackjack at ICE, an iGaming trade-show.</p>
<p>However, the game has since been released on the live network, as Gambling News reported recently. All of NetEnt’s live games are broadcast from a dedicated studio in Malta, but the company’s game-development offices have been sprouting up all over the world including in Sweden, Poland and the United States.</p>
<p>Speaking of the United States, NetEnt has been driving steady forays into the country. The vendor’s products are now already available in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, but also up North in Canada. At the end of 2018, NetEnt has decided to close some of its operations to boost its overall game-development arm, but the company is now equally interested in rev up expansion efforts in the United States as well.</p>
<p>Recently, NetEnt bought Red Tiger Gaming for £220 million, the first such move from the Swedish studio which has kept a very purist stance until now.</p>
