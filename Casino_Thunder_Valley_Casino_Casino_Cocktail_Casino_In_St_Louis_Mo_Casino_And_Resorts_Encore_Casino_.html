    <h1>Casino Thunder Valley Casino Casino Cocktail Casino In St Louis Mo Casino And Resorts Encore Casino</h1>

<p>Earlier this year, Szerencsejáték Privately Held Company Limited (SZRT), the company behind Hungary’s national lottery, awarded EveryMatrix the public tender to provide the TippmixPro brand with advanced digital sports betting software solutions and services.</p>
<p>The agreement was awarded to EveryMatrix following a 15-month competitive procurement process that attracted over 25 participants.</p>
<p>Several months later, the lottery brand has gone live with OddsMatrix-powered sportsbook and platform services. This is one of EveryMatrix’s most ambitious integrations yet and involved many of the company’s teams. SZRT will now benefit from EveryMatrix’s decades of experience in the online sector.</p>
<p>As a result, players in Hungary can now enjoy modern online sports betting experiences. Hungarians will be able to access new features such as Cash Out and Bet Builder and benefit from promotions like Stake-Back Special for the first time.</p>
<p>The new sportsbook features proprietary models that generate unparalleled market uptime and AI tools that deliver tailored recommendations to players. Bettors are further engaged via a revolutionary promotions engine that is designed to bolster retention and reactivation.</p>
<p>The partnership has an emphasis on responsible gaming and thus provides players with a variety of tools players can use to moderate their playtime.</p>
<p>Endless Possibilities Await the Two Companies</p>
<p>SZRT’s president and chief executive officer, Andrea Mager, commented on the matter, pointing out that her team first launched its sports betting platform a decade ago. The relaunch of the TippmixPro brand, now powered by OddsMatrix, is a major milestone for the SZRT team and the Hungarian players.</p>
<p>During the following months of development, it became clear to us that beyond the business partnership the company offers professional knowledge that ensures the long-term development of TippmixPro, providing our players with a world-class online sports betting platform. Andrea Mager, president &amp; CEO, SZRT</p>
<p>Ebbe Groes, EveryMatrix’s chief executive officer, also commented on the matter, expressing his delight about the launch with SZRT. He said that this is the beginning of a “relationship filled with endless possibilities.”</p>
<p>Our mission is to craft not just a sportsbook, but a never-ending story of innovation. Just as athletes persistently train to refine their abilities, we are equally determined to create new plays, redefine the game, and develop groundbreaking products that propels SZRT as the benchmark for sports betting excellence. Ebbe Groes, CEO, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Groes added that the launch underlines the quality of his team’s solutions, services and expertise across multiple disciplines.</p>
