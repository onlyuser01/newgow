    <h1>Durant Choctaw Casino Casino By Niagara Falls Fourwinds Casino Tama Casino Casinos In Denver SOFTSWI</h1>

<p>The leading iGaming software provider, SOFTSWISS, announced it was recognized by one of the most-anticipated events within the gambling vertical, the Baltic and Scandinavian Gaming Awards 2023 (BSG Awards 2023). The company revealed that it was recognized as the Best Sports Betting Provider in the Baltics, reaffirming its leadership position within the region and the popularity of its technology.</p>
<p>One of the most important factors that contributed to the award is the company's online sports betting software platform called SOFTSWISS Sportsbook Platform. The unique and innovative platform delivers efficiencies for operators that can benefit from gamification tools and integration options which can be delivered via iFrame, the company's Game Aggregator or APIs. Additionally, the online sports betting platform offers engaging options such as bonuses, including Hunting Bonus, Freebet Bonus and Lootbox Bonus, among others.</p>
<p>The latest recognition reaffirms the success of the SOFTSWISS Sportsbook Platform which boosted its offering earlier this year via the integration of the SOFTSWISS Jackpot Aggregator. According to the popular developer of online gambling content, this marked a milestone moment as it enabled operators to introduce jackpot campaigns within sports betting operations, a move that boosted significantly player engagement.</p>
<p>Alexander Kamenetskyi, SOFTSWISS Sportsbook's Head, shared his excitement about the recent BSG award in a statement. He outlined: "This recognition is a testament to our unwavering commitment to delivering quality and innovation in the iGaming space."</p>
<p>Finally, Kamenetskyi noted: "We are grateful to the award jury for acknowledging our accomplishments and, most importantly, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to our incredible team. Their dedication and diligence have been instrumental in driving us to this remarkable achievement."</p>
<p>Recently, SOFTSWISS released data regarding the interest in cryptocurrencies, pointing to a 45% surge in crypto bets for the first quarter of 2023. That announcement came after the International Gaming Awards recently recognized SOFTSWISS for its dedication to cryptocurrencies. The company was nominated and consequently won the Crypto Company of the Year award.</p>
<p>Overall, the number of crypto bets in Q1 this year increased by 44.66% when compared to the results from the same period in 2022. While this marked significant growth, a comparison with Q4 in 2022 marked only a marginal increase of 2.24%. Yet, the year-over-year results reaffirm the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Before that, earlier this month, SOFTSWISS signed a new deal with Winfinity, a fast-growing provider of live casino solutions. Under the terms of the deal, content from the provider was integrated with SOFTSWISS Game Aggregator.</p>
