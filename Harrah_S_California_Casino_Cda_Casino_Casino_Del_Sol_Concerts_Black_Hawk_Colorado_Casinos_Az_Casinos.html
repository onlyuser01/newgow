<p>Champions Club revealed that it canceled its $2 million guaranteed poker tournament planned for September. While no specific reason for the cancelation was released, reportedly the poker club is facing opposition from the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Champions Club Cancels Dallas Event</p>
<p>With each month passing by, more COVID-related restrictions are being lifted and poker is returning with full force in states like Pennsylvania and Nevada. However, this may not be the case for Texas, where a big $2 million guaranteed poker tournament planned for September was canceled last week. Although casino gambling is illegal in the state, poker rooms are allowed to operate legally and organize tournaments. The tournament, which had to take place at Champions Club poker room in Dallas, was canceled by the organizers last week. Although it was planned to launch on September 14 and run for 8 days in a row until September 21, the tournament was not rescheduled but canceled instead.</p>
<p>“We regret to inform you that our September poker tournament in Dallas has been canceled,” Reads a statement by Champions Poker Club on Facebook</p>
<p>In a statement on Facebook, Champions Poker club revealed that the poker tournament was canceled, but did not reveal a specific reason for the cancelation. The organizer added that the Champions Club in Dallas is expected to open this fall and offer “a full complement of entertainment options.“</p>
<p>The Poker Club Faces Opposition from Residents</p>
<p>Although there may be approximately 100 poker rooms operating in Texas, not all of them operate without hassles. The Champions Club is planned to be located at a former restaurant close to North Dallas Parkway. The private member club is expected to open this fall and operate 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>However, not everyone agrees with the venue’s plan. In fact, according to the news outlet 5NBC DFW, a demonstration was held only recently against the poker room. The president of the Bent Tree North Homeowners Association, Jeremy Camp revealed that a poker room operating 24 hours a day “doesn’t belong in the neighborhood.” Additionally, he revealed that a petition on the topic has already collected more than 1,000 signatures after only 4 days. As it turns out this is not the only opposition that Champions Club is facing. An organization known as North Dallas Alliance, which represents 60 homeowners’ associations is also against the plan of the poker club.</p>
<p>For the moment, the Champions Club has not revealed if the neighborhood outcry is behind the cancelation of the tournament. Besides the opposition that the poker room is facing, the reason behind the cancelation may be a financial one, suggests CardsChat. The same organizers behind the Champions Club have previously organized another event at their Houston property back in April and May this year.</p>
<p>The event featured a $1 million guarantee, but high interest boosted the prize pool to more than $2 million. Undoubtedly the event was successful, but it may have brought financial problems for the Houston location, considering that it closed weeks after the event. Additionally, besides the temporary closure, the Champions Poker Group revealed that the venue is expected to open at a new Houston location.</p>
