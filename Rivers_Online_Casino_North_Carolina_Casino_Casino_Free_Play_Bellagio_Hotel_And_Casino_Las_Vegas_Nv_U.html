    <h1>Rivers Online Casino North Carolina Casino Casino Free Play Bellagio Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Nv U</h1>

<p>After successful wagering and account validation I contacted support about withdrawal limits/combining withdrawals etc and was told by 2 separate staff that I could cash out with LTC as I had previously used it to deposit. During cash put audit I was told by financial team to cash out with bank transfer. I'd rather not as it's lengthy and expensive whereas crypto is instant and free. I tried explaining this to 3 different support staff only to be told use bank transfer. Bugger.</p>
<p>So I tried filling in the bank transfer cash out and it has option for BSB, yep cool, then IBAN, yeah nah don't use that in Australia, and nowhere for my bank account number to go. So i Googled what to do and it says to put BSB and account number all in a line with no spaces, forget IBAN box.</p>
<p>Tried that and it will only accept 6 numbers. So got back on chat and told staff. Waiting foe 'escalation to appropriate department'.</p>
<p>Why the bloody hell can't I use LTC to cash out if I've used LTC to deposit is what I wanna know????</p>
