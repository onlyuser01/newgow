<p>Studio and developer of online casino content Realistic Games has become the latest company to debut on the Romanian market through a link-up with Superbet, an established name in the iGaming market in the country, Casino Guru News learned via email press release.</p>
<p>Realistic Games will start with a number of pre-approved games that will hit the Romanian market for the first time and be as of right now available on Superbet.

<p>Commenting on this opportunity, Realistic Games Account Manager Amy Brewis said that the studio is determined to expand and grow its reach. She added that it was a long-lasting ambition for the company to have its products debut on the Romanian market, and especially so with a respected brand such as Superbet. Brewis further added:</p>
<p>"We are excited to see players’ reception to our titles as we continue to expand our reach across the region post-debut."</p>
<p>Presently, the ONJN has given green light to 15 titles that will be available to launch with Superbet, which include some excellent and player-favorite games, such as European Roulette, Book of Charms and Gorilla Riches.</p>
<p>Superbet Gaming Director Mark Flood was similarly happy with the nature of the partnership and said that the brand was committed to providing players with exclusive and worthwhile titles. Superbet has an ongoing commitment to bring the best games to Romanian players and thus become a go-to choice for local gamers.</p>
<p>"We are delighted to announce the debut of our Realistic Games partnership and we are happy to see that its games," said Flood. These games are fun and focused on responsible gambling, which is part of the operator’s integral growth and success strategy.</p>
