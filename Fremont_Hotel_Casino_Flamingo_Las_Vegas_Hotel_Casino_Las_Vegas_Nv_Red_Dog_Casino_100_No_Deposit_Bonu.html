    <h1>Fremont Hotel Casino Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel Casino Las Vegas Nv Red Dog Casino 100 No Deposit Bonu</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have referred buy a friend he mentioned that yous assist with casino disputes.</p>
<p>So I had an issue with Viperspin Casino for a withdrawal for over 20 thousand dollars, I was advised by Roman that the withdrawal cannot be completed due to having a duplicate it account. I was then asked why I had an duplicate account, I explained that that the first account I had opened up with Viperspin I had forgot the password and I couldn’t reset the password because my email (markieguo@gmail.com) is not longer active, so I couldn’t recieve the password changed link. At that stage I had informed Viperspin online support chat that I would like to close the original account as just created a new one. I was under impression that the original account was shut until I tried to make a withdrawal I wasn’t able to.</p>
<p>was asked to refer to term and conditions, relating duplicate accounts. I wanted to know when I spoke to only chat and asked them to close my original account and told him I’ve just made a new account, shouldn’t I at that stage been made aware that this will be a breach of terms and conditions, I just feel like now that if it was a serious matter they should not let me open a secondary account. (Ps If I was playing both active account at the same time I can understand why they would refuse to pay my wins) my situation was not like that Viperspin can confirm that when the second account that I created was active the original account wasn’t active at all after that. Or even before then.</p>
<p>to be honesty I never win on the pokies let’s face it who really does. So when I actually got a decent win for once to me it seemed like Viperspin wanted to get out of rightfully paying me. Respectfully I believed that I done nothing wrong of the nature in a malicious or indicative manner, my self have a duplicate account was due to the fact that I could get into my original account anymore.</p>
<p>Roman had explained to me that my winnings cannot be paid out due to the breach, however told me that all my deposits on my secondary account will be refunds as a courtesy made as if it sound like they were doing me a favour. My initial deposit I have made equivalent to around $4,600.00 so I had agree to them term think that that’s the best result I was going to receive.</p>
<p>I follow this twitch streamer called Aus slots reached out to him to see if he could help resolve this issue. Viperspin as told the streamer they will offer to reopen my account and delete my original account if I would like. So i was a little bit confused I thought that was original what i requested when chat with the online Viperspin chat team when closing the original account.</p>
<p>Viperspin have refunded my initial deposits made and now have closed the original account so I have been told and offer me a $250 euro 40x as well. I thought I come here and see if anyone has sort of gone through the same issue, and I wanted to see the outcomes resolved on guru.com</p>
<p>look at the end of the end I can understand you or the casino have a business to run, however I just think it’s unfair for some people who actually had a legitimate reason to have another account as well as notified your colleges of my actions and to get notified of my actions however allowing me to continue, wouldn’t class that as not a breach because you have been told of any wrong doing?</p>
<p>I can understand why their are policies and rules and term and conditions it’s their to protect the business from cheats or cheater, I never thought they would use those rules no to pay the their client of their winning. However continue to take their deposits.</p>
<p>I do believe getting my initial deposit back and a $250euro bonus with x40wager still is quite unfair considering that I have continued with your casino just know that it was never really a problem. And after seeing some of the closed cases they definitely got a better deal than me. Could you please assist me I have all the correspondence sent back to Viperspin regarding this,</p>
<p>look forward to heard back from you</p>
