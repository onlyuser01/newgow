<p>BoyleSports’ chief executive officer, Vlad Kaltenieks, said that racing is an integral part of the Irish DNA</p>
<p>BoyleSports, an Irish gambling company, has unveiled a new partnership deal with Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) Racecourses, HRI’s arm responsible for running the company’s racecourses throughout the country. The three-year deal will see the two parties collaborate until 2027.</p>
<p>As per the arrangement, the bookmaker has renewed its sponsorship of the Irish Grand National, a major racing event in Ireland. In addition to that, BoyleSports will serve as the official betting partner for the Leopardstown summer series. Additional sponsorships will see the bookmaker sponsor the Grade Three Joe Mac Novice Hurdle and the Grade Two Webster Cup Chase.</p>
<p>The deal with BoyleSports will once again cement the Irish Grand National as the richest race in the Irish National Hunt calendar, allowing it to offer a prize pool of €500,000 ($543,000).</p>
<p>BoyleSports’ commitment as principal partner of the Fairyhouse Easter Festival will also see it sponsor two more Easter weekend races, further reaffirming the operator’s overall commitment to Ireland’s betting sector.</p>
<p>HRI Racecourses Praised BoyleSports’ Commitment to Irish Racing</p>
<p>BoyleSports’ chief executive officer, Vlad Kaltenieks, commented on the agreement with HRI, saying that racing is an integral part of the Irish DNA. Because of that, his team is happy to continue supporting the sector.</p>
<p>With our new extended sponsorship as official betting partner to the summer series, we look forward to switching from a thrilling Easter Festival at Fairyhouse to a cracking summer of racing and entertainment at Leopardstown. Vlad Kaltenieks, CEO, BoyleSports</p>
<p>HRI Racecourses’ chief executive officer, Paul Dermody, also commented on the matter, praising BoyleSports for supporting Irish racing. Dermody thanked the bookmaker for its continued support and the extension of multiple sponsorship agreements.</p>
<p>Partnering with Irish racing continues to deliver significant commercial opportunities and value to brands and we look forward to supporting BoyleSports in the activation of this agreement. Paul Dermody, CEO, HRI Racecourses</p>
<p>In the meantime, BoyleSports continues to oppose Ireland’s proposed gambling reforms and, along with Sky Sports Racing, has warned that it might leave the Irish sector if it’s not exempted from Ireland’s proposed gambling ads ban.</p>
<p>However, James Browne, the Irish minister tasked with revamping the industry, slammed the scaremongering efforts and the misinformation attempts.</p>
<p>In other news, BoyleSports recently expanded its leadership team, welcoming Michail Koutsoukos as head of customer engagement.</p>
