    <h1>Casino Del Sol Tucson Az Resorts Casino Catskills Casino Offers Casino Hotels In Blackhawk Colorado</h1>

<p>Hello ... I am still waiting for my withdrawal although the confirmation has already been sent to me .. I am confronted with these messages ...</p>
<p>Is it all right?</p>
<p>I would like to get it all at once ... but the casino doesn't respond to this question.</p>
<p>I won a total of 71,000 euros .. of which 4000 euros were paid out .. the remaining amount 67,000 euros</p>
<p>First message from the casino:</p>
<p>Hello Ilhan,</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy this email!</p>
<p>How has it been lately Is everything okay with your experience with us? I saw that you hadn't played in a while and wondered if there was a reason for this.</p>
<p>With that I want to remind you that for a faster processing of your transactions you still need to have constant activity on your account and the easiest way to do this is by playing, which is also your winnings.</p>
<p>On this line I would like to add that your account activity is the biggest factor in prioritizing your withdrawals and can also directly affect your current limit.</p>
<p>If there is no activity for more than 7 days the system will detect this and lower the limit to the standard of 2000 and processing will not be prioritized as the system will see it as an account with little to no activity. In this case, it can take up to 7 working days for 2000 to be processed.</p>
<p>You have our full support on this matter and we are ready to assist you further. However, we also want you to keep your account activity as it was before so we can keep pulling strings for you.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Hannah B.</p>
<p>Second message from the casino</p>
<p>Hello Ilhan,</p>
<p>In this context, please note that there is a technical problem that is causing the amounts to be missing in the account.</p>
<p>It should be fixed asap.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and understanding.</p>
<p>With best wishes,</p>
<p>Finance team</p>
<p>Please check this time if everything is correct .. and briefly give notice .. what the next steps would be.</p>
<p>thanks in advance</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
