    <h1>Sunrise Casino No Deposit Bonus Leelanau Sands Casino Lodge Okada Casino Www Livada Casino Com Blog</h1>

<p>The provider of quality online casino games, Swintt, announced the release of its newest Premium slot game, promising engaging experiences and mouth-watering prizes, Rich Lady Deluxe. The new slot game comes packed with engaging features such as Pearls and Pots, as well as instant-win prizes and grows further the offering of the leading iGaming content supplier.</p>
<p>As a SwinttPremium game, Rich Lady Deluxe invites the players to "experience life in the lap of luxury" and delivers easy pick-up-and-play mechanics. The new slot game features quality casino-style graphics, complemented by classic sound effects. The game's vibrant colors and animations help elevate the excitement further, while its rewarding features ensure the players are constantly at the edge of their seats.</p>
<p>Swintt's latest title has a variable RTP, features a €0.10 minimum and €100.00 maximum bet. Rich Lady Deluxe is a medium volatility slot with 50 paylines, a max win multiplier of x1,080 of the player's bet and 19.24% hit frequency. Not unexpectedly, the game supports nearly two dozen languages as well as a variety of different currencies.</p>
<p>David Mann, Swintt's Chief Executive Officer, commented on the latest release in a statement. He revealed that the latest Premium slot game arrives just after the Festive season and grants players a chance to secure different jackpot prizes with a bet that can be as little as €0.10 per spin.</p>
<p>Mann added: "Boasting an instant-win mystery bonus and the return of our popular Pearls and Pots feature, Rich Lady Deluxe offers players multiple routes to big wins and even lets them buy directly into the latter game if they don’t feel like waiting to trigger it manually." Finally, he said: "As such, it’s a Premium release in every sense of the word and we expect it to become a huge hit at all partner casinos when it launches this month."</p>
<p>The popular Pearls and Pots is a feature that is present in other SwinttPremium games. To activate the feature, players need to land six pearl symbols on the reels. Once this is done, they "will be granted three free spins on a new set of reels where only pearls are present, and whenever a new one of these icons appears, the free spins counter will reset to allow them to further prolong the feature."</p>
<p>This feature will continue until there are no new pearl symbols appearing or all 15 positions on the reel are filled. As a result, the values of all pearls will be summed up and players will secure a bonus prize. If all the reels are filled in, a 2x multiplier can also be activated.</p>
<p>On the other hand, players who collect pearls that display jackpots such as Minor, Major, Maxi or Mega can unlock the special jackpot round. A minimum of three identical symbols need to be secured during the bonus round while the jackpot prize would be added to the total bonus collected.</p>
