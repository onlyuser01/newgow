<p>The gamified gambling operator Hero Gaming has strengthened its leadership by hiring a distinguished industry veteran as its new chief executive officer. The one up to the task is Patrick Jonker, a professional with years of experience in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Hero Gaming Acquires an Experienced CEO</p>
<p>As a part of Hero Gaming, Jonker will join its Maltese office and will guide the company forward. He will help Hero Gaming to expand its business and will “lead it on to the exciting opportunities that lie ahead.” He is replacing the operator’s previous chief executive, Tomas Backman, who left the company in October 2021 to join the investment company Waahlin Holdings as a partner.</p>
<p>As described in the original announcement, Jonker boasts 20 years of experience in the gambling and digital entertainment industries and has worked for various companies in the field. His experience includes a four-year tenure with Betsson Group where he served as general manager of the casino and sports betting business. Jonker later joined the popular gambling operator William Hill and served as its international managing director.</p>
<p>Jonker is Glad to Join the Team</p>
<p>Jonker is honored to join the Hero Gaming team and is looking forward to leading the company. He spoke on his appointment and shared that he hopes to “take the company into the next phase.”</p>
<p>The newly-hired CEO said that he is impressed by the conversations he has had with the Hero Gaming management team as they all seemed very ambitious and motivated to scale the business up. Jonker added that he is very attracted to the agile way of working and believes that Hero Gaming already has great foundations set in place. Jonker added that he will assist in creating an approach that puts Hero Gaming ahead of its competition.</p>
<p>“The iGaming industry is in constant movement and one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. Now that is an exciting place to be in! Together with the management team I will be working on the strategy and future plans to make sure that we are one of the winning companies and outgrow any competition.” Hero Gaming CEO Patrick Jonker</p>
<p>Georg Westin, the chairman of the company, welcomed Jonker to the team. He said that he is glad to be joined by such a seasoned leader. According to Westin, Jonker has all the qualities Hero Gaming needs from its CEO and is a perfect fit for the company. Westin is excited to see how Jonker’s leadership will guide Hero Gaming forward. Hero Gaming recently expanded into sports betting through a partnership deal with BETBY.</p>
