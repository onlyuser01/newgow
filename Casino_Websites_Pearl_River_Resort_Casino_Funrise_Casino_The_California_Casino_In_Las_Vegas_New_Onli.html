    <h1>Casino Websites Pearl River Resort Casino Funrise Casino The California Casino In Las Vegas New Onli</h1>

<p>playing at all casinos owned by Hero gaming speedy,simple casino and casino heroes was fine.after winning 4000 euro with a small deposi and cached out the next day the problems began . on 27/28 june at simple casino i was winning litlle every round and then i discided to raise my bets to around 300 E every bet but it was impossible to win several rounds and my balance went hard down from 4000 to 2000 i was able to predict the nex winning number i was pretty sure the number 8 would come out my bets were accepted and the ball was spinning around after the ball lost the speed seconds before ball drop suddenly i got a message that my bets were rejected and indeed the 8 came out and i got only my initial bet back 320 euro i immidiatly went on the live chat and uploaded a screenshot with the message [bets rejected]due this distraction i lost 2 more big bets in the same section direct after this with winnings of 3600 euro..my bet on number 8 was 36 or 45 euro straight i am missing [36x36=1296-320=876] or [45x36=1620-320=1300]after 2 weeks investigation by the provider i got email :our team contacted the game provider and they checked this also from their end .they checked your game activities from that date and they could not locate the round with betrejection by mentioned details and the rounds with winning number 8 were all resolved and settled succesfully.</p>
<p>as confirmed above there are no winnings due from the game play.!this above is all b.s first of all it is very easy for them to check my complain due just going back in the live chat history were i uploaded the screenshot with the rejection bets message.i am pretty sure there is a human intervene in this rejecting big bets and dont allow players to win big amounts and distract them from the game.there is a slightly delay in the stream and they can easily reject the bets.i have several rejected bets but for smaller amounts around 300 euro total but they refused to refund i find this kind of scam.win is a win if i was fysicly in the casino and betting on the same table and something occur i would be refunded any time so why not online if you claim the tables are live.i had this with other big brands but they refunded my missing wins and that is the way it should be carried out.after emailing them to do more investigation i was told that the case is in the relevant department after waiting for more 10 days i got an email that my case was resolved and that they already replied to me .other words it was my connection it was all my fault.these kind of casinos profile you and will everything to prevent you from winning big amounts in collaboration with their provider.</p>
<p>i want my missing winnings!it is actually a shame to beg for something you won fairly the casino should be ashamed of their selfs to let a customer to go thru this.if you need any screenshots or email traffic i am ready to send when asked.thanks</p>
