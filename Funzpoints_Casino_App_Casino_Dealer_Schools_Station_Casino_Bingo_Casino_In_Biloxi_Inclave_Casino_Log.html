    <h1>Funzpoints Casino App Casino Dealer Schools Station Casino Bingo Casino In Biloxi Inclave Casino Log</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint and forwarding all the relevant communication. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Before we’ll contact the casino and ask for their standpoint, could you please forward emails or screenshots showing that you have sent requests for the self-exclusion. My email address is petronela.k@casino.guru. Did you specify in those requests for how long you wish your account to be closed and why?</p>
<p>I have checked terms and conditions on the website, and this is what I found https://www.ozwincasino.com/responsible-gaming:</p>
<p>„Self-Exclusion from the Casino</p>
<p>At Ozwin Casino we provide a self-exclusion mechanism that effectively freezes your account for a prescribed period of time. A self-exclusion form is an agreement between you — the player — and Ozwin Casino. It is a document stating that you would like not to have access to the casino for a set amount of time — be it a week, a month, a year, or even permanently. Please contact our customer support team via email, chat or phone and we will guide you on the next steps. Once you have filled in and signed the form and sent it back to us, we will freeze your casino account for the term specified in the self-exclusion agreement. The account will only be re-activated once the term is up and Ozwin Casino management has reviewed the decision."</p>
<p>I have seen live chat transcripts, but could you please clarify if you have ever requested a self-exclusion through this specific form? Could you please advise how much is your active balance now?</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
