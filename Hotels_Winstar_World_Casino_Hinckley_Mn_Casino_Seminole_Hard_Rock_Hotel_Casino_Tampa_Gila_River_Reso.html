<p>Dear Melanie,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. I have checked terms and conditions, and this is what I found:</p>
<p>"In the eventuality that You use a credit card or effect a bank transfer or any other payment method to deposit funds in Your Account, the name on the credit card or bank transfer should be identical to information held in Your Account. Third party deposits are prohibited. Should we discovered that this has occurred, We reserve the right to confiscate Your winnings and return the last deposit made to the rightful owner of the payment method. Any charges levied by the banks/payment gateways will be deducted from the reversed amount."</p>
<p>Please understand that this rule has been breached. Some exceptions might be allowed by casinos when depositing funds with joint card, but this was not the case. I’m very sorry but we can’t help you with this query. If there is any additional information that would support this case, please do not hesitate to contact us, otherwise I will be forced to reject your complaint. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
