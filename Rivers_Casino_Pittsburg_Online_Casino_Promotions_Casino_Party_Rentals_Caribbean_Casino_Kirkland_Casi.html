<p>The driver, identified as Alexander Jay Dawkins, 34, was charged after Friday’s motor vehicle accident. Counts include DUI, failure to properly maintain a travel lane or improper lane change, and owner failing to show proof of insurance, KLAS, a local TV station, reported.</p>
<p>It is unclear what substance led to Dawkins’ alleged intoxication.</p>
<p>Dawkins was injured in the accident and the ensuing car fire. He was transported to University Medical Center. Details on his injuries weren’t immediately available, though media reports said he lost consciousness during the crash.</p>
<p>NEW VIDEO: FIERY STRIP RESCUE This afternoon around 4:37 pm, our @LVMPDCCAC officer and a bystander pulled a driver from a burning car near Las Vegas Boulevard and Siegfried and Roy Drive. pic.twitter.com/t1kCG43a8w — LVMPD (@LVMPD) January 28, 2023</p>
<p>Arrested at Hospital</p>
<p>Dawkins was arrested at the hospital on Friday and had a court appearance on Saturday. No bail was set because officials had yet to submit a criminal complaint, KLAS said. He’s scheduled to reappear in court on April 24.</p>
<p>The approximate 4:30 p.m. accident occurred after the white sedan Dawkins was driving went out of control and crashed into a palm tree in the center median on the Strip, close to Siegfried and Roy Drive and the Venetian casino.</p>
<p>The car was traveling south on Las Vegas Boulevard before the accident.</p>
<p>In a dramatic video republished nationally, Dawkins was seen being pulled from the smoky car by a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) officer and a bystander. Seconds later, the vehicle burst into flames.</p>
<p>Officer, Bystander Called Heroes</p>
<p>The cop and the good Samaritan were praised as heroes and credited for apparently saving Dawkins’ life. Neither was identified in the initial reports.</p>
<p>Just as the first officer arrived, smoke was coming from the car’s engine and spreading inside the vehicle. Flames were already under the car. The officer apparently broke one of the car’s windows and, with the help of the passerby, pulled Dawkins away from the vehicle.</p>
<p>A second officer soon arrived. The trio of rescuers carried Dawkins further from the wildly expanding car fire. A third LVMPD officer at the scene grabbed a fire extinguisher and attempted to quell the flames, which soon engulfed the car. The officer had to back away from the blaze.</p>
<p>Local firefighters arrived and were able to extinguish the car fire.</p>
<p>Before the initial officer arrived, some passersby tried to assist Dawkins. After arriving, the officer warned them to move to safety as the smoke spread. The initial officer suffered smoke inhalation. He was examined at a local hospital as a precaution.</p>
<p>The initial officer is expected to be back on duty for his next regular shift, police told KVVU, a local TV station. The officer is assigned to the LVMPD Convention Center Area Command.</p>
<p>As police investigated the crash, traffic along the Strip got delayed. Several casinos are located nearby, and Friday evening is a traditionally busy time for gaming properties.</p>
