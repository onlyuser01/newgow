    <h1>Caesars Online Casino Michigan Hollywood Casino Columbus Ohio Lodge Casino Casino Maryland Biloxi Ca</h1>

<p>Hi sure I discussed their answer was that the casino is not theirs and they only take a small percentage then checking my account they tell me that there is a 96 per cent they should pay but it is not said that they make me win because it is a causal thing .... so they don't even know what to tell me and they advise me to take a break that I didn't do, then knowing that the winning percentage was high I continued because I lost a lot and I repeat it had never happened in years one thing like that I would like to understand how the thing evolves can you help me? Do I have to go through the law? regarding the chronology there is no way to copy and paste there are so many plays.</p>
<p>This is one of the first answers by betting ..</p>
<p>Dear customer, We apologize for the previous replies, but we thought you were referring to the bonus.</p>
<p>As for the winnings, unfortunately there is no certainty that the game will return a certain amount.</p>
<p>The payout percentage is respected nationwide and game-by-game.</p>
<p>In theory, the single player can lose even hundreds of thousands of euros, and it is not certain that the game will necessarily pay .. because in the meantime some other player may have won.</p>
<p>In his case from 01 December to 09 December, there is a total played of 124,777.45 and a total won of 110,052.46 ; therefore by difference it lost 14,724.99 (of which 500 of fidelity bonus).</p>
<p>At the moment there is a payout percentage of about 88% on your gaming account, but it is not certain that if you continue to play you must necessarily recover ... indeed you could continue to lose ..</p>
<p>What we recommend is to put self-limitations on the gaming account, to avoid losing these sums.</p>
<p>Finally, we remind you that the casino games are not ours, but are from suppliers authorized and controlled by state monopolies, and are present on all Italian sites; we have a percentage of what our customers play</p>
<p>We remain available for further clarifications and we recommend once again to insert self-limitations in the game account.</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
<p>Here we are talking about an online casino where at least 75 per cent is returned on a certain amount I feel scammed I hope to have help thanks</p>
