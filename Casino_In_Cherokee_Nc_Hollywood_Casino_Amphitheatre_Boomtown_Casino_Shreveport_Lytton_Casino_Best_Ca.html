    <h1>Casino In Cherokee Nc Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Boomtown Casino Shreveport Lytton Casino Best Ca</h1>

<p>This morning to my surprise my account was blocked and the cause is because I have two accounts. For over a year I have been playing on your site and I have never in my life created two accounts. I was even surprised by the message and I directly concluded that it was masked theft. Several days ago I sent my documents for verification and on the eve of the release you tell me I have several accounts.</p>
<p>I've been playing on your site for more than a year and a half and I've never had a problem. I've always been straight so why go create a second one even though I have an account that works? I wrote to the service they the same thing It is simply and purely stolen and I do not agree. I never did that, accuse me wrongly. I will go to all the forums to explain your bad faith and get justice.Y</p>
<p>ou're wrongly accusing me of taking my money and that's wrong. Since I created my account I have connected on several phones in a year and currently I have 4 phones where I connect depending on the one I have in hand and I have also changed email 3 times apart I didn't do anything, I never created an account. Maybe it's the change of e-mail address that is causing the problem?! Maybe the agent who made the change of email didn't do it well, that's why you think I have several accounts. Normally you should provide proof of my package and I'm waiting but as it's stolen I know you won't be able to prove that I have two accounts. I am writing to you so that you can report that it is an error and I want proof and data from the so-called second account I created. The name The address The email Telephone number If I see this I will agree with you (I know you can never be right because a second account with my name and information DOES NOT EXIST) You're totally robbing me there's $2800 in my account I await an answer Thank you</p>
