<p>The two NFC West rivals meet for the third time this season, this time in the Wild Card game. Their two regular-season duels finished both in San Francisco‚Äôs favor, who covered the spread each time. This Saturday, the spread is set to 10 points ‚Äì the highest so far. The reason behind this is that the boys from California are playing fantastic football right now.</p>

<p>Seahawks Hoping for a Miracle</p>
<p>Pete Carroll‚Äôs team finished the regular season with a 9-8 record, thus getting a Wild Card berth. It wasn‚Äôt easy, though ‚Äì they booked the postseason ticket only after beating the Los Angeles Rams (by a field goal in overtime). Even that wouldn‚Äôt be enough if the Detroit Lions didn‚Äôt beat the Green Bay Packers a few hours later. But they did it and the Seahawks got themselves into the playoffs.</p>
<p>They can count themselves very lucky to make the postseason, but they cannot count on luck in the Wild Card game against the Niners. They need to give their maximum in order to try and beat their NFC West rival for the first time in the post-Russell Wilson era.</p>

<p>In the first season with Geno Smith as their starting QB, the Seahawks didn‚Äôt do too bad offensively, which was kind of unexpected. Their average in the regular season was 23.9, which made their offense ninth in the NFL.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs got to worry them is that in the Saturday Night Football game, they‚Äôre locking horns with the league‚Äôs best defense ‚Äì San Francisco‚Äôs defense is allowing just 16.3 points on average.</p>
<p>Niners Looking for Their 11th Straight Win</p>
<p>Despite having some real problems with injuries at the start of the season, the Niners managed to finish with a 13-4 record, thus clinching the No. 2 position in the NFC standings, just behind the Philadelphia Eagles (14-3). The most impressive fact is that they won 10 games in a row, beating some real heavyweights along the way.</p>
<p>Even though the Niners are playing with third-string quarterback Brock Purdy, they‚Äôre doing unexpectedly great in the offense. In the Week 18 game against the Arizona Cardinals, Purdy threw for three TDs.</p>
<p>Their passing game has been solid, but it‚Äôs their running game that‚Äôs their most dangerous weapon. With Christian McCaffrey and Elijah Mitchell in top form, the Niners have nothing to worry about scoring.</p>
<p>Seattle Seahawks vs San Francisco 49ers Prediction</p>
<p>The Niners are better than the Seahawks in literally every aspect of the game. Their passing might not be too great without Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo, but we do have faith in Brock Purdy. He might not throw 3+ TDs on Saturday, but at least he won‚Äôt make a major blunder that could cost his team dearly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Niners defense is expected to show up again. We just can‚Äôt see Geno Smith &amp; Co. breaking the Niners‚Äô defensive wall. At least not too many times.</p>
<p>Picks: San Francisco 49ers to win but not cover the spread; under to hit</p>
