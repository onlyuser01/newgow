<p>OddsMatrix Data Feeds has expanded its content offer with Kiron Interactive, a software and technology company focusing on sports and sports betting products and solutions. Moving forward, OddsMatrix Data Feeds will feature virtual games by Kiron to provide even more compelling experiences to partners.</p>
<p>EveryMatrix’s solution is a well-rounded product that delivers scores, real-time settlement, betting odds, and more. OddsMatrix Data Feeds covers more than 100,000 live events and it brings data about both mainstream sports and esports.</p>
<p>Kiron Interactive is a refreshing addition to the company’s lineup as Kiron focuses on building virtual sports and number games, which is different than OddsMatrix’s traditional products. Kiron Interactive has so far developed a long portfolio of outstanding games, including Dog Racing Platinum Hounds, Stock Car Racing Maxcar, Table Tennis Pro Pong, Harness Racing Charging Chariots, Basketball Final Hoops, and more outstanding products.</p>
<p>OddsMatrix Data Feeds is a solution that is setup with the idea of providing partners with a range of tools and options that allow them to consistently increase their profits and performance criteria across the board.</p>
<p>OddsMatrix Business Development Officer Alexandra Jones welcomed the opportunity to power the Data Feeds product suite with even more virtual sports options. He hailed the new partner’s opportunity to create compelling titles and said:</p>
<p>The virtual sports betting scene has grown into an important betting vertical in recent years. We’re positive that Kiron’s extensive experience and impressive portfolio of virtual sports will be a great addition to the OddsMatrix sports data offering.</p>
<p>Kiron Interactive co-CEO Steven Spartinos was similarly pleased with the latest partnership and said that OddsMatrix is above all else a trusted partner that will lead to revenue growth. Spartinos is confident that this partnership will allow Kiron to reach even more players in the sector.</p>
<p>He further added that the company was committed to building and distributing the industry’s best virtual sports and collaborating with the "right partners" to bring them to audiences in different regions and jurisdictions. EveryMatrix has been committed to building up its presence in the sports betting space and this latest partnership is a further step in that direction.</p>
<p>The company finalized the acquisition of Leapbit earlier in 2022 and used it to further enhance the OddsMatrix product suite.</p>
