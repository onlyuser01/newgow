<p>Manchester City vs. Crvena Zvezda is the first game the reigning Champions League champion will play in its title-defending campaign</p>
<p>Manchester City is a -1667 favorite to beat Crvena Zvezda, meaning that if Pep Guardiola’s men fail to do it, it’s gonna be one of the biggest upsets in the history of the Champions League. So, is there a way the Serbian team can grab a point (or all three) against the mighty Cityzens?</p>
<p>The short answer is no. However, considering that Crvena Zvezda players live and breathe the Champions League, it’s only natural to assume they’re going to give their utmost on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Manchester City Eager to Start Its UCL Title Defense</p>
<p>The big news coming from Manchester City is that coach Pep Guardiola is back after missing a couple of games due to back surgery. He’s back, which is great news for the Cityzens, although even without him in the dugout, they did very well. With his assistant Juan Manuel Lillo Diez in charge, Man City destroyed Fulham 5-1 on September 2.</p>
<p>That’s actually not much of a surprise given how impressive this team’s roster is in 2023. There are, however, a couple of problems in the Man City squad. The thing is that a couple of their key midfielders are out with an injury, most notably, Kevin De Bruyne, who’s widely considered the best midfielder in the world in 2023.</p>
<p>Mateo Kovacic is also struggling with fitness, and the same goes for Jack Grealish. Nevertheless, the Cityzens do have plenty of quality backups to take their place in Tuesday’s game.</p>
<p>Crvena Zvezda Going All-In on the Defense on Tuesday</p>
<p>The boys from Serbia realize that they stand no chance of beating the reigning Champions League champ. However, it would be crazy to go to Manchester waving a white flag. Instead, they’re going to do their best to try and keep their sheet clean.</p>
<p>It sounds crazy to think they can stop Man City’s offense, but these guys are pretty good defensively. They’ve got a good goalkeeper, Omri Glazer, who’s the first-choice goalie for the Israel national team. They also have Austrian international Aleksandar Dragovic in the defensive line, along with Milan Rodic, Uros Spajic, and a few others who play for the Serbian national team from time to time.</p>
<p>Crvena Zvezda also has a very good midfield, with most of the key players in this area being defensive midfielders. That said, you can expect these guys to be all over the field on Tuesday, trying to ruin Man City’s attacking actions. Will they pull it off?</p>
<p>Manchester City vs. Crvena Zvezda Prediction</p>
<p>Manchester City will win this game, but we don’t think the Cityzens will blow out the Serbian team. The visitors are going to park the bus in front of their goal, so finding the net won’t be easy for the hosts. But they’ve got Erling Haaland and the rest to find the net at least once.</p>
<p>Picks: Manchester City to win &amp; under 3.5 goals</p>
