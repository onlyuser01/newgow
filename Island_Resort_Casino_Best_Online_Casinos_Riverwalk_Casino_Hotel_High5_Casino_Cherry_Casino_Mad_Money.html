    <h1>Island Resort Casino Best Online Casinos Riverwalk Casino Hotel High5 Casino Cherry Casino Mad Money</h1>

<p>Hallo und kurzes Update von mir.</p>
<p>ich bin gerade stinksauer. Mein Konto wurde geschlossen weil es angeblich ein Duplikat sei. Mein Partner und ich haben getrennte Wohnungen, ich bin aber immer bei ihm, also nutzen wir die gleiche IP Adresse. Das würde wohl gegen die AGBs sein und deshalb wird mein Konto geschlossen. Das ist auch direkt passiert, ich kann mich nämlich nicht mehr einloggen.</p>
<p>Ich habe diese Mail vom Casino bekommen, die mich sprachlos macht. Bitte helft mir!</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>During the review of your withdrawal, some duplicate information was found to be linked to an established player account in our system.. Per our site Terms and Conditions which I have included below for quick reference, a person can only have 1 players account per person, per household, per IP address, per email, per access device, etc. Any accounts that do share any of these and are made after the original account are considered a duplicate.</p>
<p>The account in question is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tina S<strong><em>* - tinas</em></strong>@aim.com. This account was registered 3 months ago. IP address login history shows there are 4 main IP locations used all within the same city. 100% of gameplay has been on Book of Fallen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong>*</strong>* This account was registered 7 months ago. IP address login history shows at least 5 main IP locations from 2 different cities. 80% of gameplay has been on Book of Fallen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When analyzing login history for the last 3 months, the 4 locations the Tina account has used since creating this account have been shared with exact matching IP address locations used by ****. All 4 locations are consistently used by both accounts. Both accounts spend all their time playing the 1 same slot game. While there could be many scenarios to contradict our conclusion, it appears highly probable 1 person is using both accounts and playing their 1 favorite game. Or it is 2 people in a household that often together daily. Both of these situations violate our terms and conditions of 1 account per person, per household, per IP address, etc.</p>
<p>Being the 7 month old account is the original, any other accounts found to be violating our terms and conditions would be considered the duplicate account. Both accounts have last logged in within the last 24 hours and both from the same IP location of 95.90.213.191.</p>
<p>The terms and conditions violated are listed below. The result of this violation as stated in the terms is voiding of all wins and refund deposits less the amount of void wins. The voided wins are 1290 and total deposits is 275. Since the wins are higher than the deposits, the less amount is a 0 refund. The duplicate account will be closed. The original account will remain open and is the only account you can use without violating the site terms.</p>
<p>Here are the exact terms and conditions from the website:</p>
<p>4.5 Your Account must be registered in your own, correct, name and personal details and it shall only be issued once for You and not duplicated through any other person, family, household, address (postal or IP), email address, browser, Access Device or any environment where Access Devices are shared (e.g. schools, workplaces, public libraries etc) and/or account in respect of the Services. Any other accounts which You open with us, or which are beneficially owned by You in relation to the Services shall be "Duplicate Accounts". We may close any Duplicate Account (but shall not be obliged to do so). If we close a Duplicate Account:</p>
<p>4.5.1 all bonuses, free bets and winnings accrued from such bonuses and free bets obtained using that Duplicate Account will be void and forfeited by You;</p>
<p>4.5.2 we may, at our entire discretion, void all winnings and refund all deposits (less amounts in respect of void winnings) made in respect of that Duplicate Account and, to the extent not recovered by us from the relevant Duplicate Account, any amounts to be refunded to us by You in respect of a Duplicate Account may be recovered by us directly from any other of Your Accounts (including any other Duplicate Account).</p>
<p>I know this is not a situation you will be happy of. It is unfortunate to have to do this but we must follow the terms we set. These terms are very common in the industry and followed by most all online casinos. You are welcome to play here and use your original account and claim offers with your deposits. But. we can only allow 1 account and bonus use per household.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Die haben mich betrogen, ganz einfach!</p>
<p>Wir haben verschiedene Adressen und verschiedene Mailadressen. Ich bin eine andere Person.</p>
<p>Das ist doch unglaublich. Was soll ich tun?</p>
