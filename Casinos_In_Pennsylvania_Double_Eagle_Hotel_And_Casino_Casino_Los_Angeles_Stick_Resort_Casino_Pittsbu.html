<p>Wazdan has further expanded its footprint in the Bulgarian iGaming market with the company strengthening its ties with a local and prominent operator of casino games of chance, ELITBET.bg. Wazdan will introduce its portfolio of games in waves, allowing ELITBET.bg and players to adjust to the influx of refreshing and innovation-focused titles.</p>
<p>Wazdan will naturally be starting off with 9 Coins, 9 Lions and Magic Spins, all of which are the operator’s top-performing and best-received games. Wazdan is also bringing with it a range of specific features that the company has developed in a bid to create fresh ways for players to experience popular casino gameplay and mechanics.</p>
<p>Hold theJackpot, Cash Infinity and Collect to Infinity are among the star and signature features by Wazdan that will now be enjoyed by players locally as well, and specifically through ELITBET.bg’s established casino platform.</p>
<p>Wazdan CCO Andrzej Hyla has welcomed this opportunity and he said that the company was indeed very happy to be increasing its presence in Bulgaria. ELITBET.bg is an important partner for the company locally, and the collaboration will bring mutual benefits.</p>
<p>"By rolling out our best-performing games, we’re confident we can add value to its growing casino brand and deliver excellent entertainment to players," Hyla noted. ELITBET.bg CEO Viktor Kirilov was similarly pleased with the opportunity to explore these ties and strengthen the company’s portfolio of games with a variety of titles and brand-new mechanics.</p>
<p>"We strive to be the go-to destination for players in Bulgaria looking to enjoy a slot experience, and Wazdan’s products are another step on our journey to achieve this," Kirilov explained. Wazdan has been growing its footprint elsewhere at a good clip in the meantime.</p>
<p>The company established a brand new partnership with NEO.bet seeking to strengthen both its own reach and help its new partner provide players with a better range of products. Besides Europe, the company has been similarly involved in the iGaming market in the United States where Wazdan has been gaining one partnership after the next.</p>
<p>The supplier teamed up with Hard Rock Bet in New Jersey earlier in January and has been actively building up its footprint in 2024 already.</p>
