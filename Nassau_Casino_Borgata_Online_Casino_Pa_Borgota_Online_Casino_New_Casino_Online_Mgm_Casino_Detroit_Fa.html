<p>Fanatics Betting and Gaming has confirmed that it has secured a new partnership with Paysafe, which will see the latter provide the Fanatics Sportsbook with traditional card payments and alternative payment methods (APMs), the company detailed in a press release.</p>
<p>Fanatics is happy to benefit from Paysafe’s streamlined integration, which will deploy the full range of solutions with the sportsbook platform and enable it to pursue growth and offer customers a seamless payment journey, which is crucial for driving retention and engagement rates for online operators.</p>
<p>Fanatics Sportsbooks will benefit from Paysafe’s card transactions across a number of states, including Ohio, Tennessee, Kentucky, Massachusetts, and not least Maryland.</p>
<p>Paysafe ensures that the payments are carried out quickly and efficiently. Paysafe President of Global Gaming, Zak Cutler, has welcomed the chance to partner with yet another gambling company, hailing the fairly nascent Fanatics brand as one of the most significant players in the vertical.</p>
<p>"We’re confident that our ‘all in one’ payment solution will exceed the transactional expectations of Fanatics Sportsbook’s diverse customer base and support the brand’s growth in its current and future markets," Cutler added.</p>
<p>He is not alone in welcoming this piece of good news, as Fanatics Inc. SVP of Strategic Operations Kathleen Boord was similarly happy to see the Fanatics Sportsbook platform benefit from a reliable payment processing company that will ensure that players can transact their money fast and efficiently.</p>
<p>Both Boord and Cutler hope to see this turn into a long-term partnership that benefits both brands. Apart from traditional card payments, the partnership will enable customers to pick from a selection of APMs thanks to Paysafe’s model that allows for third-party payment specialists to offer their product and power the customer journey from their first deposit to their last withdrawal.</p>
<p>Paysafe has been a preferred payment partner for many companies in the United States, specifically. The specialist has been able to secure a similar alliance with Betr earlier this year, the brand backed by Jake Paul and Joe Levy.</p>
<p>Apart from its Betr alliance, the company similarly expanded in the state of Massachusetts where mobile sports betting got underway this year. Overall, Paysafe offers a robust service and it’s not far-fetched to expect ESPN BET, the namesake sports network’s upcoming sportsbook, to actually team up with the provider before long.</p>
