<p>You can think of the Senegal vs Netherlands game as the one that may decide the winner of the 2022 World Cup Group A. Both teams are expected to do well against the other two teams from the group â€“ Qatar and Ecuador â€“ meaning that Mondayâ€™s game is probably going to be the decisive one.</p>
<p>So, whoâ€™s going to win? Oddsmakers say the Dutch, and we can only agree. Netherlands winning is our top pick, but we do have a few other suggestions for World Cup props, which you will learn about by reading this game preview.</p>

<p>Senegalâ€™s Offense to Struggle Without Mane</p>
<p>Although Senegal fans were praying their best player Sadio Mane was going to be able to play in Qatar, he was left out of the World Cup squad. Without him, Aliou Cisseâ€™s boys are bound to struggle in the final third.</p>
<p>BREAKING: Sadio ManÃ© will miss the World Cup, Senegal confirms. He will not be able to be part of the squad as heâ€™s not recovering from his injury. ðŸš¨ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡³ #WorldCup2022 pic.twitter.com/RIn9ISBGi0 â€” Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) November 17, 2022</p>
<p>This goes especially for the game with the Netherlands. Why? Because the Dutch have an incredible backline. On the bright side for the Senegalese, so do they.</p>
<p>Chelseaâ€™s mountain of a man, Kalidou Koulibaly is their captain, whoâ€™s gonna play the role of the central defender. Right next to him is going to be Pape Abou Cisse, a 6â€™6 giant from Olympiacos. And behind those two is Senegalâ€™s goalie, Edouard Mendy.</p>
<p>Knowing this, itâ€™s almost certain the Dutch are going to struggle to score on Monday. Theyâ€™re going to struggle but will their struggles result in a goal (or two) in the end?</p>
<p>The Dutch are a Mystery in 2022</p>
<p>Led by legendary Louis van Gaal, the Netherlands seem like a team that could achieve a lot in Qatar. They even seem capable of making it all the way to the final. At the same time, they also look like a team that could make big blunders in this World Cup.</p>
<p>The thing is that theyâ€™re incredibly strong in some parts of the pitch, while in some, they look mediocre. For instance, their defense could be the very best on the planet with Virgil van Dijk, Matthijs de Ligt, Stefan de Vrij, Denzel Dumfries, Daley Blind, and others.</p>
<p>Van Gaal's biggest headache is the goalkeeper. He dropped Jasper Cillessen who moved to Dutch club NEC from Valencia. He then handed the Remko Pasveer his first senior cap at the age of 38 in September. However, the Ajax shot-stopper has seen a drop in form at the club level. â€” The Football Index ðŸŽ™ âš½ (@TheFootballInd) November 11, 2022</p>
<p>Their goalie, however, might be their weak spot. The thing is that van Gaal decided to leave out his former starting goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen. Instead, he brought Justin Bijlow, Remko Pasveer, and Andries Noppert with him to Qatar.</p>
<p>Whoever gets between the sticks, probably isnâ€™t going to do wonders. Nevertheless, we do think the goalkeeper is likely to keep a clean sheet on Monday against Senegal.</p>
<p>Senegal vs Netherlands Prediction</p>
<p>We think Senegal will not score on Monday. Without Mane, they just look incapable of putting one away against the Dutch. But what about vice versa?</p>
<p>Senegal too is great at the back, but we do think the Netherlands will score at least once. The Dutch might not have any superstars in their attacking department â€“ apart from Barcaâ€™s Memphis Depay â€“ but their midfield is packed with players who can win games on their own.</p>
<p>Frenkie de Jong, Steven Berghuis, Davy Klaassen â€“ we think one of these guys might score the winner against Senegal.</p>
<p>Picks: Netherlands to win; under 2.5 goals</p>
