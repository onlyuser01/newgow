    <h1>Saratoga Springs Casino Hotel Lincoln Casino Kats Casino Login Casinos In South Dakota Renaissance S</h1>

<p>Good afternoon Petronela!</p>
<p>I made the account a few months ago, but I only started betting more frequently in December 2023. I made approximately 5 deposits, all of which I used the bonuses available for my account, on the "promo and actions" page of the site.</p>
<p>In this last deposit I did not activate the bonus, but I bought a package in the store they have available, with 35 spins on the Book of Piramide game. I saved a sum of around R$500.00, money that was also converted into bonus money. You needed to bet an amount of R$25,000.00 for this money to be converted into a real balance. At first I believed it was impossible, that it would just be money that would stay there for "fun", but after playing A LOT I managed to revert the balance to real money. And the amount of R$ 2,600.00 was left.</p>
<p>Most of the games I played were SLOTS, but I believe I played some live games too (bingo and roulette).</p>
<p>It seems to me a strange attitude from the casino to claim that I am a fraudulent person without at least asking me to confirm my identity, all deposits made through the platform came from my bank account. In other words, if there was any doubt regarding my identity, why didn't they ask for it as soon as I made my first deposit? It was necessary to have a gain for them to have this behavior. This seems like a scam on their part!</p>
<p>My daughter and her wife recommended the casino to me, they told me that it would take a while for me to receive the winnings, but I really didn't believe I could go through that situation!</p>
<p>I am disappointed!</p>
<p>Many thanks to the Guru Casino team for their support</p>
