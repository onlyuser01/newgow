<p>It took just a little longer than expected, but Rush Street Interactive has finally obtained its license in Ontario, Canada, as the province prepares to launch the biggest iGaming market yet. BetRivers, the company’s flagship iGaming brand will be arriving at the market on April 4 when private licenses are allowed to formally launch in Ontario, amid a highly anticipated move that has already attracted a number of gaming companies, among which 888 Holdings, PointsBet, Rivalry, and theScoreBet.</p>
<p>Rush Street Serious about Real Money Gambling in Ontario</p>
<p>The list of companies clamoring for an entry is growing and the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) is still in the process of allocating permits. The latest suppliers to enter the market in anticipation of high demand for unique gaming titles include Gaming Realms and Bragg Gaming Group which are now approved in the state.</p>
<p>RSI CEO Richard Schwartz welcomed the opportunity to be joining the market and thanked AGCO for the support.</p>
<p>“The receipt of our registration in Ontario is an important milestone that demonstrates our commitment to operating only in legalized markets where we pay local taxes, and we are grateful for the trust of the AGCO.” RSI CEO Richard Schwartz</p>
<p>Thanks to this permit, BetRivers is getting closer to the full rollout in what may soon be the most lucrative iGaming market in North America. BetRivers has plenty to offer as well, including one of the best peer-to-peer slot tournaments, Schwartz argues. The company is known for its fast payouts, excellent customer support, and the potential to service every iGaming and betting fan in the province.</p>
<p>In fact, this is not the first time BetRivers made a move to Ontario. Back in 2021, the company launched Casino4Fun, a free-to-play iGaming portal that was set to test the capabilities of the newly-fledged gaming market and create a database for BetRivers to use in its later operations in the province.</p>
<p>Time to Turn Social Gamblers into Paying Customers</p>
<p>Casino4Fun has been a great way to prepare the ground for the further expansion of the BetRivers gambling offer. The free-to-play social platform demonstrated interest in the segment. With the arrival of a real money platform, consumers who enjoyed the social experience, will find it much simpler to onboard onto the new one.</p>
<p>RSI is confident that it will replicate the same entertaining and responsible gambling experiences on the real money gambling platform set to debut soon. In the meantime, RSI is already operating in both the United States and Colombia, with its outlook on Latin America growing. The company also entered Mexico through a 25-year deal with Grupo Multimedios.</p>
