<p>theScore Bet has announced that it will debut a unique front-row viewing experience at the CP Women’s Open, which will kick off at the Ottawa Hunt &amp; Golf Club next week. Greenside Lounge will be available to all of theScoreBet’s players.</p>
<p>The Greenside Lounge Will Provide Viewers With Tons of Benefits</p>
<p>Aubrey Levy, the senior vice president of content and marketing at theScore Bet, shared a few words on the Greenside Lounge. He stated that viewers will have the chance to watch golf events from the best seats on the courses and thus, enjoy a lot of comfortability.</p>
<p>She also added that they will be flexible with time as they won’t be required to arrive early or wait in line. Instead, a shuttle will take guests across the course and they will be able to choose the view from any of the 11th, 13th or 14th greens.</p>
<p>An exclusive “members lounge” will be available to theScore Bet users on fairway 17 as well.</p>
<p>Levy also stated that theScore Bet is “proud to support the CP Women’s Open” and work with Golf Canada to bring the unique experience to life. The partnership that theScore Bet has with Golf Canada also includes sponsoring the RBC Canadian Open.</p>
<p>Golf Canada’s chief commercial officer, John Sibley, stated that the 2022 CP Women’s Open will result in the return of the world-class LPGA Tour golf. He added that the company is looking happy to assist theScore Bet in providing golf fans with a unique and VIP experience.</p>
<p>theScore Bet Provided RBC Canadian Open Championship Viewers With the Same Experience</p>
<p>Back in June, theScore Bet introduced a similar viewing experience to the RBC Canadian Open Championship. theScore Bet Skyline Seats overlooked the St George’s Golf and Country Club’s 1st and 18th holes and elevated fans 100 feet above the action.</p>
<p>Levy stated that the seats were a “fresh, new type of sponsor activation” for an event. In addition, Levy stated that the goal of the viewing experience was to provide fans with something memorable and unique which will add value to the event.</p>
<p>Most recently, theScore Bet exited the US market to focus on expanding in the Canadian market. Ontario’s gambling market opened on April 1, 2022, and the company considers that the markets where it already operates are not worth the effort.</p>
<p>theScore Bet also launched a big responsible gambling campaign in Ontario in May. Bet Mode Responsibility’s goal is to educate gamblers on the potential dangers that come from excessive gambling and how not to push the boundaries of online wagering.</p>
<p>Levy stated that player education and responsible gambling are embedded in the company’s operations and that is why it was important to roll out an RG campaign that is in line with its launch in Ontario.</p>
