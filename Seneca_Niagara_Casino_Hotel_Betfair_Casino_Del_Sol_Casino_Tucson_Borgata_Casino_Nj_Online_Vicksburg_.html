    <h1>Seneca Niagara Casino Hotel Betfair Casino Del Sol Casino Tucson Borgata Casino Nj Online Vicksburg</h1>

<p>The Baltimore Ravens just love playing against the New Orleans Saints, the evidence being that they lead the all-time series 10-2. The last time the Saints beat them was in 2018 when the Ravensâ€™ placekicker Justin Tucker missed a game-tying extra point in the final moments of the game.</p>
<p>The game in question was the last time these two met in the regular season. They did play one pre-season game last year, which the Ravens won by three points. Incidentally, three points is the point spread set by the bookmakers for the Week 9 MNF game.</p>

<p>Lamar Jackson to Record His First-Ever TD Pass Against the Saints</p>
<p>The last time the Ravens played a game was Thursday Night of Week 8. What this means is that they had more days to prepare for this game than the Saints. Will it matter in MNF? It certainly wonâ€™t do them any harm. But, even if they were completely unprepared for Week 9, weâ€™d still think of them as the favorites.</p>
<p>The Ravensâ€™ defense has been superb this season, conceding 22.9 points per game. This might not seem like an impressive number, but keep in mind that theyâ€™ve played against some really amazing offenses â€“ Buffalo Bills, Cincinnati Bengals, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, etc.</p>
<p>Lamar Jackson is a cheat code ðŸ˜¤</p>
<p>(via @Ravens)pic.twitter.com/2WhhVIT3Pc â€” NFL on ESPN (@ESPNNFL) October 28, 2022</p>
<p>When it comes to their offense, itâ€™s all about Lamar Jackson. The quarterback is fourth in the NFL in terms of passing touchdowns with 15. Heâ€™s also scored two rushing touchdowns on his own.</p>
<p>The best thing is that his form keeps improving â€“ he threw for 10 TDs and scored 2 rushing TDs in the previous three games.</p>
<p>Knowing that the Saints are one of only three teams that he hasnâ€™t thrown for a TD against (or scored a TD on his own), you can be sure that heâ€™s gonna be super-motivated to change that.</p>
<p>New Orleansâ€™ Quarterback Roulette</p>
<p>Which New Orleans Saints quarterback will get the starting role on Monday Night? Coach Dennis Allen is probably the only one who knows. It can be either Andy Dalton or Jameis Winston, who still may have some fitness issues.</p>
<p>Whoever gets the job, we donâ€™t expect him to put on a vintage performance in Week 9â€™s MNF game. Sure, Baltimoreâ€™s passing defense isnâ€™t great, but we also donâ€™t think New Orleansâ€™ receivers are good enough to cause chaos in the Ravensâ€™ rear.</p>
<p>Instead, the Saintsâ€™ strongest weapon is their running game. With players like Alvin Kamara, Mark Ingram, and even Taysom Hill, itâ€™s no surprise the Saints are great in carrying the ball. The trouble is that the Ravens defenders are great when it comes to stopping the opposition charges â€“ they rank fifth in opponent rushing yards.</p>
<p>Baltimore Ravens vs New Orleans Saints Prediction</p>
<p>The Ravens look stronger than the Saints in all aspects of the game. This, of course, doesnâ€™t mean the boys from Big Easy arenâ€™t good. Itâ€™s just that Lamar Jackson &amp; Co. are better. That said, we think the oddsmakers have made a fantastic job with the point spread â€“ we think this game will be decided by a single field goal.</p>
<p>Picks: Baltimore Ravens to win and cover the spread; under to hit</p>
