<p>Alex Cassettari, former Senior Manager for Procurement Services at BT and BT Sourced, has joined global gambling group Flutter Entertainment as Head of Procurement Services.</p>
<p>Switching from Telecoms to Gambling</p>
<p>Cassettari announced his new role as Head of Procurement Services at Flutter Entertainment on LinkedIn, outlining that the gambling industry is entirely new for him after more than 20 years of working in telecoms.</p>
<p>“This is a completely new industry for me after working in telecoms for more than 20 years. I’ve already met some great people who I’m very much looking forward to working with.” Alex Cassettari, Head of Procurement Services, Flutter Entertainment</p>
<p>Cassettari, a veteran in the area of procurement, will perform his duties from Flutter’s office in London, returning to the city after nearly three years in Dublin with BT and BT Sourced, having joined the British telecom giant in September 2019.</p>
<p>Before joining BT, Cassettari spent nearly 11 years performing in various roles at TalkTalk, since his appointment as a Revenue Assurance Analyst in January 2009, climbing up the corporate ladder to Head of Procurement Operations in October 2016.</p>
<p>His professional career started in January 2005 when he was appointed as Tariff Manager for mobile operator Orange, and 18 months later was promoted to Revenue Assurance Analyst, a role he performed until he joined BT.</p>
<p>A graduate of Cardiff University, Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy and Religious Studies, Cassettari describes himself as “an experienced leader with senior management roles in Procurement Operations, Transformation and Revenue Assurance,” successful in “building and delivering a finance transformation program, implementing process improvements and automation, … driving cultural change, [and] sharing best practices.”</p>
<p>Recruitment Flurry Continues</p>
<p>Cassettari is the latest addition to the management team at Flutter Entertainment, following shortly after the appointments of former Paddy Power advertising manager Karen O’Rourke, who joined as Chief of Staff for CEO Peter Jackson, and the hiring of the former executive of ASDA Leah Spears as Head of Brand for Paddy Power.</p>
<p>O’Rourke returned to London to replace Portia Walker, who was tasked to manage the integration of recently acquired Italian brand Sisal as the £1.62 billion ($2 billion) transaction with CVC Capital Partners Fund VI initiated last year is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, while Spears joined Flutter from Class-ify after more than a year with the health and fitness platform in a move she described as “dream come true.”</p>
