<p>Hello, and thank you for your results!</p>
<p>From my point of view, though, the math is actually quite normal.</p>
<p>The way I see it, its very important to distinguish between games with high and low volatility, because the bets should be adjusted to optimize your preferred outcome - what you call a profit.</p>
<p>Maybe a little fact won't hurt:</p>
<p>There are high volatility and low volatility games</p>
<p>When you play low volatility games, you win quite often, but the winnings are often lower than your bets .</p>
<p>When you play high volatility games (for example jackpot games are often high volatility games), you can have a dead spin after a dead spin, maybe 50 in a row, but then you enter a special bonus feature and win a big part of your losses back . Anyway, if you stop playing earlier, you feel like the slot didn't pay you anything</p>
<p>Additionally:</p>
<p>If a game RTP is 96%, it means that if you start with $1,000,000,000 and then play 1,000,000,000 rounds at $1 each, then you should end up with approximately $960,000,000 dollars.</p>
<p>If you play just a few hundred rounds, your current return may vary from 30% up to 1000%. But the more rounds you play, the more likely you’ll be closer to the statistical RTP of the slot game. That’s why such big numbers were used in the example above.</p>
<p>As a result, no winnings are guaranteed, and the longer you play, the more likely it is that you'll end up dry.</p>
<p>Frankly, I have nothing to add when it comes to Pragmatic Play games and the unchanged winners. I agree; it looks pretty weird. So, have you asked the game provider or the casino?</p>
<p>Obviously, I can't provide the answers you seek on this matter. But I'd like to know what you find out.</p>
