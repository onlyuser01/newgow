<p>Gambling.com Group has received approval to provide its marketing services to Illinois and Tennessee.</p>
<p>KAX Media American in Tennessee</p>
<p>Digital marketing services giant Gambling.com Group announced on November 24 that its US subsidiary KAX Media America has secured a 3-year license from the Sports Wagering Committee of the Tennessee Education Lottery Corporation to operate in the Volunteer State.</p>
<p>The vendor registration license is valid for an initial period of three years, effective immediately.</p>
<p>Tennessee is home to three professional sports teams and more than six million citizens. The Volunteer State has the potential to become “a future leader in the regulated US market,” Gambling.com Group said in a statement.</p>
<p>Gambling.com and Bookies.com in Illinois</p>
<p>Additionally, Gambling.com Group acquired a license in Illinois, and will provide the Prairie State with sports betting coverage via Gambling.com and Bookies.com.</p>
<p>Bookies.com features news, odds, live score, and statistics, as well as independent reviews of sports betting sites in the US and the UK.</p>
<p>Gambling.com Group can now provide services to betting operators in both states, while it is already registered in Indiana, New Jersey, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>“We are excited to begin offering our services in the Volunteer State, which has the potential to be a leader in mobile sports betting, while Illinois represents the sheer scale the US market offers the gaming industry.” Max Bichsel, VP of US business at Gambling.com Group</p>
<p>More Than 50% in Net Profit for Q3</p>
<p>Gaming regulators from Illinois and Tennessee approved the group shortly after it had reported $3.3 million in net profit for the third quarter. Revenue went up 52.2% year on year, thanks to a boost of its organic traffic sources which led to a strong performance.</p>
<p>Revenue generated from locally regulated markets comprised 68% of total revenue for Q3.</p>
<p>“We are now in a position to scale investment in product and marketing with a particular focus on the fast-growing US markets and the expansion of our sports offering,” Charles Gillespie, Gambling.com Group CEO, said in the company’s third quarter report.</p>
