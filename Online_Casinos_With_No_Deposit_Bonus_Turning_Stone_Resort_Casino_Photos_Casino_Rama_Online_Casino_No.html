<p>Daniel Negreanu claims #1 spot on the WSOP Player of the Year list</p>
<p>Robert Campbell and Shaun Deeb round out the top 3</p>
<p>As WSOPE Main Event continues, anyone could become Player of the Year</p>
<p>Daniel Negreanu is now at the top of the list of the WSOP Player of the Year after placing sixth in the €25,000 Mixed Games Championship</p>
<p>Mixed Games Championship Pushes Negreanu Into POY Lead</p>
<p>While bracelets are coveted on the WSOP circuit, the Player of the Year title is a big deal. This year, we’ve seen a tight POY race, and Daniel Negreanu has just taken over the top spot, knocking Robert Campbell into second place.</p>
<p>Negreanu placed sixth in the €25,000 Mixed Games Championship at the World Series of Poker in Rozvadov, Czech Republic. While first place is always a great achievement, the pro only needed to land in this position to take him to the top of the Player of the Year leaderboard.</p>
<p>Negreanu has six WSOP bracelets to his name, so far, and he has cashed in over 130 WSOP events. The last time he won the WSOP Player of the Year award was in 2013, when he came first in the $10,000 No-Limit Hold’em Main Event at the Asia Pacific World Series of Poker and the €25,600 No-Limit Hold’em High Roller at the WSOPE. He also won Player of the Year in 2004.</p>
<p>Last year, Negreanu failed to make the Top 100 POY leaderboard. In 2017, he came close to the top spot by earning 717 points and hitting 11th spot on the list.</p>
<p>Still a Tight Race</p>
<p>He has now beaten out Robert Campbell, who had the number one spot going into the WSOPE in Rozvadov. Shaun Deeb took over for a few days, but Campbell regained his position by landing himself at the final table in the €25,500 Platinum High Roller No-Limit Hold’em event.</p>
<p>Now, there are just 261 points between the top three players on the WSOP leaderboard. There’s just one even left in the year, so it really could be anyone’s game.</p>
<p>Over 1,000 points are usually awarded to the Main Event winner, which means that even players in 15th place and above could snatch the top spot – if they are currently playing in Rozvadov. The Top 10 players currently are:</p>
<p>RANK NAME POINTS 1 Daniel Negreanu 3,971.54 2 Robert Campbell 3,857.97 3 Shaun Deeb 3,710.64 4 Phillip Hui 3,186.17 5 Daniel Zack 3,126.13 6 Dash Dudley 2,799.44 7 Chris Ferguson 2,790.42 8 Phil Hellmuth 2,742.43 9 Anthony Zinno 2,718.15 10 Asi Moshe 2,685.53</p>
