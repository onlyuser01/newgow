<p>Greentube, the digital gaming and entertainment division of Novomatic, a global iGaming supplier of tech and titles, has launched the next phase of its Ontario license obtained earlier this year. As a result, the company is now rolling out with Entain, a prominent gambling firm that operates three brands in the province, to name Bwin, PartyCasino, and BetMGM.</p>
<p>BetMGM and Greentube have already launched together in Michigan in the United States, but this is the first time that Greentube has gone live with any brand in the Ontario market since it obtained a license. This is important as Greentube has a host of titles that it is bringing to the provincial iGaming market, including the Diamond Link and Mighty Series.</p>
<p>All of these games are regarded as player-favorites, and Greentube itself, has already had hands-on experience with online casino operations in a number of provinces in the country. Greentube has deployed solutions for the regulated gaming markets in several provinces in Canada, including Quebec and British Columbia.</p>
<p>The brand is also present in Manitoba and Saskatchewan and has been building up its footprint not just in Canada, but in the United States as well. As mentioned earlier, Greentube is available in Michigan with BetMGM, and also in New Jersey. Greentube plans on further expanding its reach in the country to launch its products with tier-one operators.</p>
<p>Greentube commercial director David Bolas was happy to see his company provide content for a number of prominent figures in the regulated gambling space. It’s an important market debut for Greentube as well and it represents the company’s broader ambition for its further North Americangrowth and reach.</p>
<p>Greentube has been committed to growing its footprint in regulated gaming spaces with a particular focus on North American jurisdictions. This is why the company tied a partnership with BetMGM in Michigan and sought to strengthen its presence in the region further by buying out Present Creative, a developer of original iGaming and online casino content.</p>
<p>Thanks to this partnership, Greentube will be able to further hone its delivery and production pace and strategy and create opportunities to deploy more player-favorite titles that are developed with a distinct focus on the local market and audience preference.</p>
