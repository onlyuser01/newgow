<p>Hello, I would like to report this lousy site for the manipulation of gaming machines, with which they cause a lot of damage to people... I already reported Rabidi N.V. on another site, namely wazamba.com, when I lost 800,000 ft (~2000â‚¬) in 20 minutes on Plinko on a game called pl, which I noticed towards the end of the game, it doesn't enter results and doubles the amount of the bet.. I signaled and they shook me to delete website data etc.. I did it but it still cheated, since then I deleted myself from it, I also played on this cazim and it was very my money disappeared quickly, the game cheated me out of about HUF 50,000, which I made a screenshot of, I had already asked 3 days ago, both nicely and badly, to close my account, they didn't tell me to let me fail again.. this morning they emailed a complaint about their Plinko game I also sent a video to be investigated, and then the answer came that my account was closed at my request.. the fraud was discovered and my account was immediately closed, for which I almost begged for 3 days and they did not do it.. where can I send you a video because here the web does not allow uploading only 5 mb.. take a look, the game takes away the bet when it gives out a ball and in many cases when it falls, it doesn't even add to my balance, but subtracts it again... I want an investigation as soon as possible, because if I can't find a solution here, I will file a police report with the Rabidi n.v. against, because they take people's money by fraud.. his pages caused me HUF 1 million in damage.. I won't leave it at that, who knows how many people are beaten like this. I will send the email in which I informed them about the family. thank you in advance for your inquiry</p>
