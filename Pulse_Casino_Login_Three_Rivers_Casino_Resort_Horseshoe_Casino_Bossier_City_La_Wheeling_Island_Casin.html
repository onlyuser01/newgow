<p>Swedish gaming operator LeoVegas has become the latest member to join the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA).</p>
<p>LeoVegas Joins IBIA to Protect Sports and Customers</p>
<p>The LeoVegas Mobile Gaming Group has become the fifth operator to join the International Betting Integrity Association (IBIA) since the global monitoring body was rebranded back in June, the company announced in a new press release.</p>
<p>LeoVegas.com will now provide data to IBIA’s global monitoring system, helping it better identify instances of fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>Commenting on the developments, IBIA CEO Khalid Ali had the following to add:</p>
<p>“LeoVegas is another growing internationally-focused and multi-licensed company to join the association over the last six months. I welcome the company’s investment in, and commitment to, betting integrity and encourage all responsible operators to join our collective effort.”</p>
<p>Mr. Ali further added that IBIA had taken an ‘unrivalled position in the global integrity discussion,’ and had a clear focus on protecting all participants as well as guaranteeing the integrity of contests.</p>
<p>Rebranding of ESSA to IBIA seeks to expand association’s reach to betting companies worldwide, not just Europe. https://t.co/1NFBJXfYlK — Daniel Wallach (@WALLACHLEGAL) June 4, 2019</p>
<p>LeoVegas was also happy to sign the partnership as it guaranteed the company a better standing in international markets, such as the Netherlands, Germany and Brazil, all of which now require membership in betting integrity monitoring bodies and a particular emphasis on protecting customers and the integrity of sports.</p>
<p>The company’s Communications Director, Hans Uhrus, further added:</p>
<p>“We are proud of the rapid expansion of LeoVegas and of our ongoing commitment to provide our customers with a safe and entertaining experience across all of our products”</p>
<p>Furthermore, a membership in IBIA attested to LeoVegas’ commitment to provide a best-in-class service, Uhrus concluded.</p>
<p>A Global Standard for Excellence and Sports Integrity</p>
<p>The International Betting Integrity Association is committed to provide operators and sports fans with a safe sports betting environment. Furthermore, IBIA ensures sports is kept clean by relying on operators to monitor and submit alerts to a centralized monitoring system.</p>
<p>These alerts usually do with suspicious activity that is investigated by members and in collaboration with competent authorities. The organization has multiple partnerships with leading sports and gambling regulators, sharing data and helping wrongdoers be prosecuted and corruption in the sector fought.</p>
<p>Four other brands have joined since June including Royal Panda, BetUK, Pixel.bet and 21.co.uk, and they are already helping IBIA keep gaming cleaner. Presently, IBIA has 38 members and the company works with Kambi, H2, and Perform as affiliates.</p>
<p>The company also runs quarterly reports on how many suspicious alerts have been reported every quarter, the most recent report focusing on Q3 2019.</p>
