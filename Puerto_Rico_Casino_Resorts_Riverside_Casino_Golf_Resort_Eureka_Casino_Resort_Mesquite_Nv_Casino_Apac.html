<p>SBTech has spread its wings even further thanks to a recent partnership with Wanabet.es, a Spain-focused online gambling operator. As part of the partnership agreement between the two companies, SBTech will now be the R. Franco Group-owned online sports betting brand’s official sports betting technology provider.</p>
<p>Why SBTech?</p>
<p>As hinted earlier, SBTech is no stranger to the Spanish market – the gaming technology solutions provider is the partner of choice for a number of gaming partners across the world and now it will be diving even deeper into Spain’s market. Wanabet.es is only the second sports betting operator to switch to SBTech’s technology. There are also others such as Luckia and Bethard that have been working with SBTech for quite some time now.</p>
<p>Just like other gaming companies that have partnered with SBTech, Wanabet.es chose the solutions provider due to its strong brand name as well as its exceptional track record. Not only do they expect to see exceptional improvements in performance but they also hope to see significant revenue bumps from their sports betting offering.</p>
<p>With SBTech’s technology, the gaming operator will be capable of offering a more personalized sports betting experience to its customers in Spain. Needless to say, for a growing sports betting market such as the Spanish one, personalized gaming experiences are definitely vital to the overall state of the sector.</p>
<p>“Spain is a rapidly evolving and growing market and to build on our success we knew we had to take our offering to the next level. We firmly believe that SBTech’s best-in-class sportsbook will enable us to achieve this and futureproof the business for many years to come,” Javier Sacristán Franco, one of R. Franco’s directors pointed out.</p>
<p>In addition to significantly improving the customer-facing aspects of their offering, SBTech’s technology is also going to help Wanabet.es to have even greater control over risk management. This will be key to its plans to improve revenue in both the long and shorts terms.</p>
<p>No Stopping for SBTech</p>
<p>While the migration of Wanabet.es is the first one in 2020, the technology solutions provider’s officials have affirmed that it was just the beginning. The company has been aggressive in pursuing its bid to grow even further by inking as many B2B partnerships with gaming operators in the European market and in newer markets in places like the United States.</p>
<p>The company has amassed a ton of experience in the sector and is now able to seamlessly migrate more operators to its platform. This kind of effortless integration is what makes its solutions so popular in Europe and across many other parts of the world. Since its launch way back in 2007, the company has dozens of partners in over 15 regions where gambling is legal and regulated.</p>
