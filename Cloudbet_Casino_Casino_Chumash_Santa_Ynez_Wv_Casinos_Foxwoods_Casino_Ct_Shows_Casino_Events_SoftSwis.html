<p>Developer of software for the online gaming industry SoftSwiss announced it has partnered with another online casino brand, Curacao-licensed Axecasino, to deploy SOFTSWISS Jackpot Aggregator.</p>
<p>Team Equally Important</p>
<p>The launch of the SOFTSWISS Jackpot Aggregator under the latest jackpot campaign of Axecasino is already improving the performance of the online casino brand by helping it attract and retain players and is serving as evidence that the revolutionary multi-purpose software product is embraced by the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new partnership agreement, Aliaskei Douhin, head of SOFTSWISS Jackpot Aggregator, paid tribute to the team behind the collaborations tasked with the implementation and support for the product throughout the partnership.</p>
<p>“We assist our clients in achieving their goals by getting deeply invested in the process,” Douhin said, hailing the company’s team that “is always there offering support at every step” by “helping assimilate new experiences and find winning combinations.”</p>
<p>Following the agreement with SoftSwiss, Axecasino launched a new marketing campaign titled ‘Axecasino Jackpot Game’ that offers three independent levels for players – Standard, Mega and Colossal – utilizing Jackpot Aggregator as a powerful marketing tool for running jackpot campaigns across online casinos.</p>
<p>Fine-Tuning the Product</p>
<p>Commenting on the collaboration with SOFTSWISS Jackpot Aggregator, the team at Axecasino was full of praise for their counterparty which was there all along: from the early discussions of plans and optimal jackpot settings to the agreement on the design and its handing over to Axecasino, and even for not refusing to help make changes to the design after everything was set and done.</p>
<p>“Thank you for being so cooperative; working with you was a real pleasure,” the Axecasino team concluded in their notes.</p>
<p>Relying on jackpot campaigns, SOFTSWISS Jackpot Aggregator empowers iGaming brands to reach their goals in terms of player engagement, acquisition and retention, and the latest campaigns achieved significant results in raising the average bet sum per player and across other key metrics.</p>
<p>In August, online casino operator BETER hired the services of another SoftSwiss solution, SOFTSWISS Game Aggregator, to reach new audiences by leveraging its live casino product as part of the aggregation platform’s offering of more than 12,000 casino games.</p>
<p>Besides the aggregation platform and the jackpot campaign tool, SoftSwiss offers online casino operators a robust casino solution, land-based lottery terminals for rent, sports betting operations management platform, feature-rich affiliate management and tracking platform, and managed services available round the clock.</p>
