<p>[2022-12-29 21:34:09] [Live Support] Welcome to Live Support! We will provide you the best service.</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:34:08] [***] u said i played it multiple times</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:34:17] [***] but it said here in terms and condition Players cannot redeem multiple free bonuses consecutively. If you have redeemed one No Deposit Bonus and are subsequently offered another one, a real-money deposit needs to have been made in the interim for you to be eligible to withdraw the second No Deposit Bonus.</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:34:45] [Brandon] Welcome to Heaps o Wins. Thank you for visiting our website.</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:34:55] [Brandon] Please give me a moment to check your account.</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:34:55] [***] but the thing is i played two consecutively then wait till the 11/8 coz u gave me a free spins</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:35:12] [***] so 11/6 and 11/8 isnt consecutive</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:36:53] [Brandon] I am sorry but multiple free chips in a row are not allowed per the terms and conditions, and every winning in that situation would be voided.</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:37:41] [***] why give me free chips then ??/</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:37:49] [***] if u know that will be voidable</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:38:01] [***] isnt it false advsertisement of promotions</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:38:12] [Brandon] As far as I can see, you used only free promotions in a row.</p>
<p>I am very sorry but you are not eligible for withdrawal or any free promotion.</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:38:58] [Brandon] Each of the promotions you have used is active and can be used but not consecutively without a deposit in between.</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:39:12] [***] yeah i know i got ur point but are u my point why email me a bunch of codes to play promoting that its free chips and no deposit bonus if you going to void it anyways</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:40:20] [***] well i guess im just going to leave a bad review as i had a bad experience on you guys so people wont make the same mistake and waste their time on this promotions</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:40:31] [Brandon] It is stated in the email that you received, as well as in our terms and conditions that multiple free chips in a row are not allowed, and every winning in that situation would be voided.</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:40:56] [Brandon] I am very sorry that you have such an opinion.</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:41:35] [***] this is just a waste of time but see u in the review</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:43:03] [Brandon] We are very sorry for your dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>[2022-12-29 21:43:52] [***] i dont care anymore im just gonna complain to the casino people of how u scam people</p>
<p>They will email u with free chips to promote their casinos and when uve used them they going to say u use multiple no deposit code consecutively and then void your winning what the heck is the point of them emailing u no bonus code deposit if they going to void anyways?</p>
