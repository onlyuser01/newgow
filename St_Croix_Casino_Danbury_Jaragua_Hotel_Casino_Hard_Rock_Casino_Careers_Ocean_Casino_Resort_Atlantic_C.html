<p>Livespins, a socially-charged casino games platform, has penned a partnership deal with Skywind. The game developer will power Livespins’ innovative streaming platform with its portfolio of slots games.</p>
<p>Skywind Powers Livespins with Games</p>
<p>As per the deal, Skywind will provide Livespins with its full suite of slot games. Livespins will add them to its live platform, allowing streamers to play a myriad of trending games. Thanks to that, Livespins users will be able to play Skywind’s critically-acclaimed titles. Those include Big top Bonanza Megaways, Shaolin Showdown and Teller of tales, among others.</p>
<p>Hilary Stewart-Jones, the CEO of Skywind, praised Livespins for a pioneer in online casino streaming. Not only that, but she also described it as a platform that is “at the heart” of the online revolution. Stewart-Jones admitted that casino streaming is increasingly popular and said that she thinks Skywind’s games will suit it well:</p>
<p>Our games have been designed to thrill and excite with each spin which makes them perfectly suited to streaming and we look forward to seeing Livespins streamers and players enjoy the fast-paced, high-engagement action they provide. Hilary Stewart-Jones, CEO, Skywind</p>
<p>Livespins Makes Gambling Social</p>
<p>Michael Pedersen, the chief commercial officer of Livespins, also commented. He pointed out that casino streaming is becoming increasingly popular thanks to the social element it has. However, it cannot stand on its own and needs exciting games to keep the audience engaged.</p>
<p>Thanks to the agreement with Skywind, Livespins will be able to add exactly that.</p>
<p>Players expect to be kept on the edge of their seats and with Skywind we have a content partner that knows how to get pulses racing and deliver the excitement and entertainment that players, and streamers, are seeking. Michael Pedersen, CCO, Livespins</p>
<p>Pedersen said that the addition of Skywind titles will improve Livespins’ portfolio and help to engage the audience.</p>
<p>Livespins is a streaming platform that allows users to watch streamers play the hottest gambling titles in the industry. The company’s ambition is to double down on the social element of gambling and allow users to communicate, watch and play together. Furthermore, audience members can join the action by placing bets alongside the streamer.</p>
<p>Players can chat, comment on the latest developments and share their two cents on the streamers’ approach. By turning gambling into a socially charged experience, Livespins hopes to engage the audience and provide it with memorable moments.</p>
<p>A month ago, Livespins also added Yggdrasil content to its platform, after signing a deal with the company.</p>
