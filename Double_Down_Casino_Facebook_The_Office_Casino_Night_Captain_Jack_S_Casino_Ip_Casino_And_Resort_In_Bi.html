<p>Baltimore Ravens vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers is the Thursday Night Football game of Week 8. Neither team can be too proud of its performances in the 2022 NFL season. The Ravens are 4-3, while the Buccaneers record is 3-4, with all of their losses happening within the past five weeks.</p>
<p>Things are getting serious for Bruce Arians’ men, who need to up their form ASAP in order to stay in the race for the postseason. Luckily for them, they’re in a relatively easy division, which is why they’re still sitting in the #1 spot despite having a negative record.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Ravens, they’re in a very challenging division, but so far, they’ve been doing okay. Their defense is solid, but QB Lamar Jackson isn’t doing great in the offense, which is what cost them a win on a few occasions in 2022.</p>

<p>Lamar Jackson in the Spotlight</p>
<p>With 25.9 points per game, Baltimore’s offense ranks sixth in the league. However, that’s the overall number, while their recent stats aren’t that great. When it comes to the month of October, the Ravens have a 20.5 PPG.</p>
<p>Lamar Jackson threw for only three touchdowns in four games his team played in October, getting four of his passes intercepted. On top of that, he got sacked on six occasions. Those aren’t great numbers, but Jackson sure has it in him to improve. After all, we saw him play terrific football at the start of the season when he threw for 10 TDs in the first three game weeks.</p>
<p>Luckily for the Ravens, Jackson’s poor performances didn’t make too much of a negative impact, mostly thanks to their superb defense. They haven’t conceded more than 24 points since September, despite facing some very offensive-minded teams in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>What’s Going on With the Buccaneers?</p>
<p>What happened in the previous game week was one of the most upsetting results of the season. The Buccaneers lost 21-3 to the Carolina Panthers. Even in normal circumstances, this would seem like a shocking defeat.</p>
<p>However, knowing that it was Carolina’s first game after trading Christian McAffrey (RB) and Robbie Anderson (WR). Plus, the Panthers played with their third-string QB, P.J. Walker.</p>
<p>Losing by 13 points after coming to North Carolina as 18-point favorites is nothing short of embarrassing. But who is to blame? Everyone, really. Their defense, which has been pretty decent in 2022 otherwise, was shockingly soft last weekend. Still, their offense seems to be in major crisis – their scoring average in the last two weeks is just 10.5.</p>
<p>Tom Brady hasn’t been great in 2022, throwing for more than one TD per game in only one game of the season. He really needs to step up ASAP; otherwise, his team will get in trouble.</p>
<p>Baltimore Ravens vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers Prediction</p>
<p>We think that the Buccaneers defence has what it takes to stop the Ravens offense. That said, whether the Bucs win or lose this game depends on their offense, that is, on Tom Brady. He just needs to start throwing more TDs and this game might be when it happens.</p>
<p>Picks: Tampa Bay Buccaneers to win; under to hit.</p>
