<p>Dear Ramunas,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your withdrawal issue.</p>
<p>The variety and accessibility of payment methods are not managed by the casino exclusively. Several factors as the Licensing Authority, geolocation, and contracts with the payment providers and bank restrictions, all have a major influence. If a payment method was available for deposits, it doesn’t mean necessarily, that it will be offered for withdrawals too. Banks in some countries refuse to receive player’s funds from gambling establishments. Unfortunately, casinos are powerless in this.</p>
<p>Sadly, since you have played your winnings, I’m afraid, there is not much we can do for you. Please understand, the player is the only one responsible for their account, active balance, and all the bets taking place. For future references, please contact us as soon as the issue evolves so we can intervene before it's too late.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if you have informed the casino about your gambling problem? Would you like to self-exclude yourself or is there anything else we could try to help you with?</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
