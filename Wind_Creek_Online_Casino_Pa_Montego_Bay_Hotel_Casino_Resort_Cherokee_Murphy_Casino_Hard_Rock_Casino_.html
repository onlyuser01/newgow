<p>Five leading gambling companies in the UK have donated a cumulative amount of $125 million to help address problem gambling issues in the country.</p>
<p>British Gambling Companies Donate More to Tackle Problem Gambling</p>
<p>GambleAware, the NGO tasked with tackling problem gambling in the United Kingdom, will receive additional funding amounting to $125 million from Betting and Gaming Council (BGC) members. The BGC confirmed the news that five of the largest gambling firms in the country had agreed to forward the amount to help address lingering concerns about reckless gaming behavior in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>As per the BGC’s announcement, GVC Holdings, William Hill, Sky Betting and Gaming, Bet365 and Paddy Power Betfair will all provide funds that will be allocated to treat people and offer help in addressing problem gambling behavior.</p>
<p>That comes following news that operators in the UK would progressively scale the total amount they contribute to problem gambling assistance from 0.1% currently to 1% of their annual revenue by 2023.</p>
<p>Commenting on this development, BGC chief executive Michael Dugher confirmed that the trade association and members were looking to “drive up standards,” for the entire industry to follow.</p>
<p>“This latest funding commitment is yet more evidence of the industry’s determination to improve the quality and provision of treatment for problem gamblers – and of our members’ eagerness to get on with it as quickly as possible.” BGC chief executive Michael Dugger</p>
<p>Officials Help with Latest Move of Solidarity</p>
<p>Many have welcomed the news, with UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock joining in to congratulate the BGC for the steady progress the organization has been making in providing players with a safer overall gambling experience in the country.</p>
<p>The BGC has been particularly active during the COVID-19 lockdown, endorsing both regulatory and protective measures during the period. Since today, all betting shops in the United Kingdom are open with punters flocking back in person while observing strict sanitary measures.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest development in funding for problem gambling, Hancock explained that problem gambling can damage people’s mental health as well as affect their lives.</p>
<p>He expressed his own determination to help such individuals and confirmed that the government would continue to tackle gambling issues by introducing more specialist services as part of the National Healthy System (NHS) and then make them available to whoever needs them.</p>
<p>Dugher Lauds Industry Efforts to Make Physical Venues COVID-19-Proof</p>
<p>Dugher commented on the progress that has gone in providing protection to both customers and staff at the site of betting shops across the United Kingdom. He congratulated Coral and William Hill for rolling out various tools, such as “call-over” betting and “sneeze screens” designed to minimize the risk of exposure and infection.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that local bookmakers have contributed a lot to the local economies, providing jobs and opportunity to engage in a specific form of entertainment. However, Dugher noted that as the industry reopens, the BGC would work even harder to ensure that everything is going as instructed by the government.</p>
<p>He concluded by arguing that the upcoming Royal Ascot week will probably see a tremendous uptick in activity as one of the few racing big events that have officially returned.</p>
