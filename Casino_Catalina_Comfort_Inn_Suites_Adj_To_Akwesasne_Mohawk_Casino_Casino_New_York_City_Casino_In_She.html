    <h1>Casino Catalina Comfort Inn Suites Adj To Akwesasne Mohawk Casino Casino New York City Casino In She</h1>

<p>New slot provider RAW iGaming has made its official debut with a much-anticipated pair of slots built around its innovative SuperSlice game engine: Wheels of Rock and Journey to Chaos. Following its “Stand out or stand down” motto, the provider has designed its SuperSlice engine in such a way that it can offer a completely different experience to players.</p>
<p>The two games that revolve around the fresh engine do not display the standard reels you would normally see in any slot game. Instead, they feature wheels. Compared to regular wheel-based games, RAW iGaming’s new slots display dynamic slices on all wheel designs. This means players will never get to anticipate the exact number of slices that will show up on a wheel, nor will they be able to foresee the slices’ contents.</p>
<p>SuperSlice Pushes All Slot Gaming Boundaries</p>
<p>RAW iGaming aims to put an end to the repetitive, standard reel game format that players have been used to in the last few decades. Instead of designing their first two slot games using the classic reels, the developer opted for wheels that can deliver completely dynamic slices.</p>
<p>A slice could either contain a Minigame or a Free Spin bonus, a symbol of a high value, it could trigger a multiplier, or it could be completely empty. The special wheel feature alternative will add a lot of thrills and anticipation to all rounds, with various features and symbols likely to pop up several times on the wheels.</p>
<p>Journey to Chaos is a slot game with the high volatility that could easily bring a player up to 25,000x the initial bet during just one bonus round. This multi-wheel game is also a pioneer in terms of cascading wheel games. The game will carry players on a mesmerizing trip in the Ancient land of Egypt, where the mighty gods will easily pay as much as 8x during a single spin in the Free Spins feature. When triggered, the Naunets Chaos Spins feature will also bring impressive 15,000x wins.</p>
<p>RAW iGaming, a “Pink Shark” in a Sea of Standard Slots</p>
<p>RAW iGaming’s Chief Executive Officer Tom Wood described the company as an interesting, unique, and peculiar “pink shark” swimming in an ocean filled with endless slots with 5×3 and 5×4 reels.</p>
<p>Wood further expressed the company’s take on the current state of things in the industry: players may not necessarily enjoy playing the same games on and on again or see more of these slots being released in the future. In other words, the wind of change is blowing over the sea every day. Accordingly, the “pink shark” is ready to stick its head out of the water and start making some waves.</p>
<p>The SuperSlice game engine is just one of the innovative solutions that RAW has in mind. While still in its “patent pending” stage, the engine has been created with the purpose of bringing players a much-needed alternative to standard gaming options.</p>
<p>The company understands how important it is to draw in fresh players while retaining current ones with the help of a truly unique and edgy game portfolio. This type of content can only be obtained by pushing a few boundaries while always delivering one-of-a-kind, unmatched gaming experiences. This is what RAW plans to do. Whether they will succeed at it or not, it remains to be seen.</p>
