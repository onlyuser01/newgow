    <h1>Directions To Parx Casino Casino In Mount Airy Casino Pa Casino Bodega Harrah S Casino Atlantic City</h1>

<p><em>UPDATE</em></p>
<p>I have been playing at this sweepstakes casino/sportsbook for about a month now, here are some insights from my experience so far:</p>
<p>The sportsbook feature has a nice interface and is easy to navigate and understand. For someone like me who doesn't bet on sports often, this detail is extremely important. With minimal knowledge of sports I am able to place bets I understand. Seems trivial but is very important!</p>
<p>The casino has a nice variety of games, but bucks definitely add some more game providers. More is better in my opinion.</p>
<p>I appreciate there being a daily log-in bonus. Keeps a cheapo like me entertained on my downtime.</p>
<p>One item of concern is the fact that for about a week ithe sportsbook was unavailable to me l, with a note stating that players from Florida were not allowed to use the sportsbook. This is a bit confusing to me. After not having access for a week, I was allowed to play again. I didn't look into it, but they did not go out of their way to explain what happened.</p>
<p>This past week I have had trouble accessing the site completely. Tested on multiple desktops and devices, there are times I have no ability to access the site at all. This is concerning and makes me more hesitant to deposit my own money.</p>
<p>I have not dealt with customer service, nor have I attempted to withdraw, so I can't comment on these aspects.</p>
<p>Those are my notes so far. As of today, I cannot completely recommend someone depositing money into the site, but I also have no concrete reason to not deposit.</p>
<p>For now I can support the decision to sign up and play with the bonus money given out. Some things were questionable as I stated above, but I do not detect any signs of scamming or foul playl.</p>
<p>I hope this helps someone today ðŸ™‚</p>
