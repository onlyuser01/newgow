<p>Online gaming software provider EveryMatrix has signed a new partnership agreement with Future Anthem, a game science and AI data specialist. Under the agreement, the latter company will supply EveryMatrix with Amplifier AI, a real-time personalization product.</p>

<p>Under the agreement with Future Anthem, EveryMatrix will integrate the Amplifier AI into its CasinoEngine iGaming integration and productivity platform.

<p>By using Amplifier AI, EveryMatrix’s partnering operators will be able to provide end-customers with personalized player experiences. The AI-powered solution will recommend games that the players will likely enjoy and will provide them with customized offers to improve their brand loyalty.</p>
<p>In addition, Amplifier AI will provide operators with lightning-fast real-time intervention.</p>
<p>Future Anthem’s Personalization Will Complement EveryMatrix’s Tech</p>
<p>The casino-focused agreement is in line with EveryMatrix’s commitment to offering best-in-class iGaming products. Future Anthem’s algorithms and metadata will complement EveryMatrix’s promotional and technical capabilities, allowing operators to improve player retention, engagement and revenues.</p>
<p>Stian Enger Pettersen, EveryMatrix’s Casino CEO, commented on the new agreement, saying that it marks an important step for EveryMatrix. By harnessing AI and investing in real-time tech, the company will be able to provide its clients and their players with “hyper-relevant and automated actions,” Pettersen said.</p>
<p>Future Anthem is a leader in real-time personalization with broad capabilities that are fast to integrate – they were a natural choice for us as we continue our efforts to deliver the best player experience possible. Stian Enger Pettersen, Casino CEO, EveryMatrix</p>
<p>Future Anthem’s chief executive, Leigh Nissim, also commented on the agreement. He said that platform features are integral to EveryMatrix’s operations, which is why the company needs to always adopt the latest technologies.</p>
<p>Nissim praised EveryMatrix’s platform for its tremendous potential and said that he is certain the company will be a great partner to Future Anthem.</p>
<p>From the moment I first met the EveryMatrix team and had exposure to the full potential of their platform, it was clear they would be a great partner to leverage the power of Amplifier AI, in real time – I’m confident that great things will come from this collaboration.
