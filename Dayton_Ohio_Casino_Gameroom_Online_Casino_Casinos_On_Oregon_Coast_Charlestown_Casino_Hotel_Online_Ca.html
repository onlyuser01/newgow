<p>Incentive Games, a leading B2B Games provider, has extended its contract with Bet Lion, an African mobile and online sportsbook company, for 12 more months.</p>
<p>Incentive Games and Bet Lion Extend Partnership</p>
<p>Incentive Games, a leading Free-to-Play and virtual sports games provider extends its partnership with Bet Lion, a popular sports betting provider in Africa, for another 12 months. Users in Africa will enjoy even more Play-to-Play and Free-to-Play sports games.</p>
<p>Since its collaboration with Bet Lion in 2018, Incentive Games’ content became widely popular among Bet Lion players. The provider is known for developing content for markets where mobile data is still expensive, which is a problem for many end-users. The games have optimization for Opera Mini Extreme mode.</p>
<p>Incentive Games CEO John Gordon stated that the company is happy to extend the successful partnership with Bet Lion and continue the collaborative efforts by launching more games with the brand. He also said that Incentive’s offerings have been specifically designed for markets like Zambia and Kenya but play exceptionally well on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p>Incentive Games continues to extend its reach. With a strong foothold on 5 continents, Incentive Games recently signed a new partnership with FSB Technology, as the latter will promote its array of games to more potential customers.</p>
<p>New Incentive Games Content on Bet Lion</p>
<p>Under the new agreement, Bet Lion will launch more games in Zambia and Kenya, including Incentive Game’s hit titles such as Pick 5, upgraded Pick 6, and Dream Team games, which attract thousands of players per week.</p>
<p>With Pick 6, users could predict the correct scores in 6 soccer games to win the cash prize. Pick 5 is a new concept that combines score predictor and virtual sports in a Free-to-Play format, meaning users predict the scores with virtual machines instead of real-life matches.</p>
<p>Incentive Games’ Dream Team has been the players’ favorite for a long time. It allows users to choose their fantasy team of 5 players from 1 soccer game to compete with other users and have a chance to win the cash prize. The 5 players either earn or lose points for the actions they take in the real-life game.</p>
<p>Bet Lion Chief Marketing Officer Jason Gibson stated that the company did not hesitate to continue the successful 2-year partnership and extend it for another 12 months. The games offered by Incentive are among the most popular with players. Gibson said that the company anticipates the launch of Pick 5 and the updated version of Pick 6 and Dream Team in the coming weeks. Pick 6 and Dream Team are favorite titles among players.</p>
<p>Gordon also said that he looks forward to the extension of the collaboration with Bet Lion, who will take the company’s content offering to the next level.</p>
<p>Incentive Games recently entered the US market, launching its free-to-play series of games on the Intralot sports betting platforms in partnership with Montana and Washington DC lotteries.</p>
