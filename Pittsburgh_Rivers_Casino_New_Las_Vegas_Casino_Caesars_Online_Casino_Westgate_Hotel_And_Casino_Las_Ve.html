<p>WinSpirit now joins the ranks of operators with an eCOGRA certification, highlighting its reliability as an entertainment company</p>
<p>WinSpirit, а Curacao-based gaming company, announced that it has secured a certification from eCOGRA, an independent expert in the testing and certification of online gambling systems. The achievement cements the operator as a source of low-risk, high-responsibility entertainment.</p>
<p>Thanks to this certification, WinSpirit has once again reaffirmed its commitment to protecting its players from harm by providing gaming entertainment safely and responsibly. Its consumers can rest assured that the casino’s games are fair and balanced.</p>
<p>In addition to this, eCOGRA also confirmed the casino’s return-to-player (RTP) rating of 97.37%, showing that players are unlikely to lose a lot of money and have many opportunities to win big prizes.</p>
<p>The certification also proves that the operator’s offering is compliant with all the necessary gambling regulations in the regions where it operates. Finally, the certification confirms that players’ personal data, money and payment information are safe with the operator.</p>
<p>The Certificate Attests to WinSpirit’s Trustworthiness</p>
<p>As a globally-acclaimed agency, eCOGRA is a reliable tester of casino content. An authority on online gambling, the firm is bullish on probing casino content and issuing certifications to companies that show strong dedication to fair play and player safety.</p>
<p>Having an eCOGRA certification sets trustworthy operators apart from their competitors, allowing players to make informed decisions when picking a gambling company to play with. WinSpirit now joins the ranks of operators with an eCOGRA certification, highlighting its reliability as an entertainment company.</p>
<p>In addition to boasting a certification, WinSpirit is also known for the variety of its offerings. The operator offers thousands of online slot games to its players, as well as many online table games and live casino titles. Sports fans can also find a rich selection of sports betting markets, allowing them to place wagers on their favorite leagues and teams.</p>
<p>eCOGRA Launched in Michigan Earlier This Year</p>
<p>In the meantime, eCOGRA’s presence continues to grow. In January this year, the UK-based testing lab expanded in the United States after being greenlit to launch in the state of Michigan.</p>
<p>The lab was granted permission to act as an independent testing lab by the Michigan Gaming Control Board, allowing it to probe the fairness and safety of local operators’ offerings.</p>
<p>Speaking of Michigan, the state recently posted data about the performance of its operators in June, highlighting stable iGaming revenue and declining performance of the sports betting vertical.</p>
<p>More recently, eCOGRA also secured approval to operate in Connecticut.</p>
