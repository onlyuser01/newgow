<p>The 2022-23 Premier League Boxing Day action kicks off with the Brentford vs Tottenham game. The Spurs are seen as odds-on favorites, but their odds have started moving against them. The (probable) reason is that several of their key men stayed in Qatar until last Sunday, which is not the case for Brentford’s players.</p>
<p>The Bees have been preparing for this game for weeks, so we can only expect a good performance from them on Monday. But will it be good enough to win point(s)? Let’s find out!</p>
<p>Brentford vs Tottenham Odds</p>
<p>Moneyline Odds Brentford +300 Draw +240 Tottenham -110</p>
<p>Over/Under Odds Over 2.5 -125 Under 2.5 +110</p>

<p>The Bees have Had Weeks to Prepare for This Game</p>
<p>Although a couple of Brentford players did go to Qatar to take part in the 2022 World Cup, their key men stayed in England. This includes the Bees’ scoring leader Ivan Toney, their goalie David Raya, and many others.</p>
<p>Further, even those who did travel to Qatar did not spend too much time there. In fact, all of Brentford’s World Cup players returned after the end of the group stage. What this means is that they’ve had plenty of time to rest and prepare for the duel with the Spurs.</p>
<p>The Spurs to Miss a Couple of World Cup Finalists</p>
<p>Sunday, December 18 was the day when the 2022 World Cup Final took place, which saw Argentina beat France on penalties after 120+ minutes of play. The players who took part in that game will probably skip the Boxing Day action – the French players are probably way too tired, while the Argentines are both tired and hungover after celebrating their first World Cup title in 36 years.</p>
<p>This is bad news for Tottenham, because two of their players played in that game – goalkeeper Hugo Lloris (France) and central defender Christian Romero (Argentina). Further, Ivan Perisic played for Croatia in the match for the 3rd spot one day before the final.</p>
<p>Not having these three on the roster sure is a major blow for Antonio Conte’s team. However, bad news do not end there – the Spurs also have a couple of injured player who will miss Monday’s game, most notably full-back Ryan Sessegnon.</p>
<p>Brentford vs Tottenham Prediction</p>
<p>Brentford is a team that just loves playing big games. This season, we already saw the Bees beat Manchester City and Manchester United, can they do the same against Tottenham? We think they might! And if they do it, it’s going to be their first-ever win over this rival.</p>
<p>Picks: Brentford to win; over 2.5 goals</p>
