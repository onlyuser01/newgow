    <h1>Harris Casino Lake Tahoe Palms Casino Buffet Shazam Casino Login Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City</h1>

<p>I opened an account with William Hill, deposited 4000 euro won another 4000 and cashed out. I was verified so I had in mind this would be a quick withdrawal. They kept asking me for the same documents, every time i went into the live chat they said; "Please upload your documents" then after telling them I already sent it they told me they would get back to me. Waiting and waiting I get another email that I’m verified again..</p>
<p>Requested another withdrawal thinking now it would work they told me I needed to upload the same documents again for their financial department. I was confused because I never had this with other casinos.</p>
<p>To me that felt like they were deliberately stalling my withdrawal. On William Hill there’s a section "reverse withdrawal" that means that after its gone from there it shouldn’t be possible to cancel as it will be moved to pending. After sending them so many documents, I spoke with a supervisor and he told me he would forward my documents. I asked him to cancel my withdrawal and he did it too while that shouldn’t be possible. A few hours later I spoke another live agent who told me I needed to forward my documents again. I told her I spoke to her supervisor who already forwarded those documents and told me all would be all right.</p>
<p>In the end I lost all the money. I played the funds because I had the feeling I wouldn’t see the money as they kept asking me for the same documents every time I spoke them and then tell me they sent it to the payment verification department. Lying and deceiving me. When I told them that they shouldn’t have canceled my withdrawal they told me that is only for UK players, which I’m not. I find it kinda predatory that they revert withdrawals that aren’t in the "reverse withdrawal section" anymore. I’ve been verified 2 times yet I couldn’t receive the money quickly. That made me sick in the stomach and I felt hopeless.</p>
