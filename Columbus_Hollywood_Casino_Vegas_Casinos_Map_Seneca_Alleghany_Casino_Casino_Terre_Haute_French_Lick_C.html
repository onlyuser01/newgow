<p>As of February 25, PokerStars will fully assimilate Full Tilt. Its desktop and mobile applications will no longer be available, and its database will migrate to PokerStars.</p>
<p>Full Tilt Retires for Good by End of February</p>
<p>Active since 2004, Full Tilt will no longer be available starting later this week. Since 2016 it has operated as a skin to the PokerStars’ network and has shared its player pool liquidity and reward programs. PokerStars confirmed the transfer of Full Tilt’s database, including player accounts, preferences, balances, tickets, and bonuses. All players who have a Full Tilt account will receive a PokerStars account automatically.</p>
<p>According to PokerStars, the company is committed to the improvement of customer experience. It has limited its focus towards Full Tilt’s evolution. The company also said that the two brands need to merge so that their players can have access to PokerStars’ newest innovative games and features available exclusively on the platform. The merge comes after Flutter, a global sports betting and gaming provider, acquired The Stars Group last May.</p>
<p>PokerStars and Flutter’s Dynamic 2020</p>
<p>The last few months have been dynamic for PokerStars and its parent company, Flutter Entertainment plc. At the end of last year, the Kentucky Supreme Court reinstated a case against PokerStars. The company faced a penalty for the period between 2006 and 2011, accused that it operated illegally in the state. Flutter faced PokerStars’ fine of $1.3 billion for the case, which was already dropped once before at the Kentucky Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>Last November, PokerStars sealed a deal with Brazilian esports powerhouse FURIA, intending to reach the young Brazilian audience by providing fresh gaming content. André Akkari, FURIA CEO, became an ambassador for PokerStars.</p>
<p>Recently, PokerStars became the first poker operator to launch services in Michigan. The operator received approval from the Michigan Gaming Control Board. With Michigan on board, the company has its services running in three U.S. states, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey.</p>
<p>Full Tilt: Learn, Chat and Play with Pros</p>
<p>Full Tilt, one of the first poker sites on the market, launched in 2004 and quickly rose to the top. With its slogan “Learn, chat and play with the pros,” the site gained instant popularity, dealing virtual cards’ to thousands of players. Full Tilt’s co-founder Ray Bitar teamed up with big names such as Phil Ivey, Howard Lederer, Chris Ferguson, and Mike Matusow. With their collaboration and innovative marketing tools, the brand was once a worldwide leader and a rival to PokerStars, but its story is inevitably ending this week.</p>
<p>PokerStars is dealing Full Tilt’s last hand, but the good news is consumers can re-buy right away into PokerStars’ network.</p>
