<p>Amid rising inflation and increase in cost of living, a new report reveals that western Sydney, Australia is responsible for the majority of the gambling losses in the region</p>
<p>The research by Western Sydney University probed into the gambling operations in Sydney, calling the activities a “silent epidemic” for the Western Sydney region. The study, titled “Paying the Price: Gambling-Related Harm in Western Sydney” uncovered that the impact of gambling-related harm is evident in Western Sydney. It said that although the region contains only 52% of the population, it is responsible for 63% of the electronic gaming machine (EGM) losses.</p>
<p>The new study uncovered that the daily losses for Western Sydney’s Canterbury-Bankstown are the highest, hitting AU$1.8 million ($1.25 million) daily. Fairfield and Cumberland, two other Western Sydney regions also suffer from significantly high daily losses to EGMs with AU$1.7 million ($1.18 million) and AU$1.2 million ($832,000) in daily losses.</p>
<p>“Western Sydney is hit disproportionately hard by gambling-related harm. The fractures that this has created across the region are evident. Gambling-related harm has a profound impact on individuals, families and communities,“ reads the report released by the Western Sydney University</p>
<p>In contrast, regions in North Sydney, report a fraction of the daily losses seen in Western Sydney. The report reveals that the daily losses in Mosman are only AU$ 170,000 ($118,000), while in Canada Bay, Hunters Hill and Lane Cove are AU$ 210,000 ($145,500). Those results reaffirm the worrying trend that Western Sydney is impacted heavily by problem gambling and millions of dollars are lost every day within some of its regions.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic and shutdowns over the last few years have resulted in a decrease in gambling activities. However, that decrease was short-lived, reveals the new report, pointing out that losses to EGMs have been gradually growing. Moreover, the study cited data from Liquor and Gaming NSW, showing that losses to EGMs have now surpassed the values recorded pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>Casinos on Every Corner</p>
<p>The new white paper unveiled that some parts of Western Sydney are impacted by the “extreme oversaturation of electronic gaming machines.” Having a casino on every corner is undoubtedly worrying and figures by the report confirm this statement pointing out that there are only 54 people per EGM in Fairfield, one of the Western Sydney regions impacted by significant losses on a daily basis. Canterbury-Bankstown, another region impacted by daily gambling losses in millions is also saturated with EGMs having only 78 people per EGM. Cumberland, another such region, has 89 people per EGM.</p>
