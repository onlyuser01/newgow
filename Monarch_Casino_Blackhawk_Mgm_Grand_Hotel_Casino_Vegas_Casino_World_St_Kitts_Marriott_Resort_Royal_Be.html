<p>Light &amp; Wonder, the business name of Scientific Games Corporation, has announced a new partnership with Konami Gaming, Inc. Under the terms of the partnership, Konami will benefit from the former’s dedicated OpenGaming platform through an aggregation tie-up with Konami.</p>
<p>US Focus on Konami’s Product Reach Expansion</p>
<p>The deal will allow Konami to integrate its portfolio of games directly with the OpenGaming platform and reach new audiences across the United States. This will result in the delivery of player-favorite Konami titles across a much bigger geographical footprint and benefit some of the most prominent igaming brands in the country.</p>
<p>First access will be granted to Barstool Players in Michigan and Pennsylvania along with Golden Nugget players in New Jersey. The games that will be featured on the OpenGaming platform include China Shores, Astronomical Magic, and Adorned Peacock to name a few.</p>
<p>The addition of titles directly benefits Light &amp; Wonder’s own business footprint as it allows it to keep adding player-favorite titles that are well-received by audiences in the United States and beyond. Commenting on this opportunity, Light &amp; Wonders partnership director Steve Mayes noted:</p>
<p>This landmark aggregation deal is a huge moment for Light &amp; Wonder as we grow our content offerings in the United States. It’s no secret that Konami is one of the biggest providers of quality content, its offering is truly second to none and we are delighted to have them on our industry leading OpenGaming ecosystem. Light &amp; Wonders partnership director Steve Mayes</p>
<p>Konami and Light &amp; Wonder Happy with Opportunity</p>
<p>Mayes confirmed that the company was thrilled to have the opportunity and offer its customers Konami’s distinct and acclaimed products. The same sentiment was expressed by Megan Wolkoff, who works as director of online products at Konami Gaming, Inc:</p>
<p>Our team is excited for the launch of this partnership with Light &amp; Wonder at a time of ongoing growth of the iGaming sector. The audience reach that OpenGaming provides is hugely appealing and means our immersive content can be accessible to even more players. Konami Gaming, Inc director of online products Megan Wolkoff</p>
<p>Wolkoff confirmed that Konami was excited to see the Konami games hit the OpenGaming platform and from there, some of the biggest igaming markets in the United States. The integration is important as Light &amp; Wonder is set to continue expanding throughout the US as new igaming markets become available.</p>
<p>There are already more than 500 games available on the OpenGaming platform, which makes it a preferred choice for many new igaming studios looking to establish a footprint in the sector.</p>
