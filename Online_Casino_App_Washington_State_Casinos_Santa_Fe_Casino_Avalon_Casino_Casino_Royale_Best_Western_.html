    <h1>Online Casino App Washington State Casinos Santa Fe Casino Avalon Casino Casino Royale Best Western</h1>

<p>1X2 Network will bring its selection of games to RoyalCasino.dk, a Danish online casino operator, which will now benefit from the numerous products available by the UK supplier of iGaming content.</p>
<p>More iGaming Content by 1X2 Network in Denmark</p>
<p>The partnership comes at an important time for RoyalCasino.dk as the company continues to increase its footprint in the country and is now looking to expand its library of titles in order to consolidate its standing in the market and quickly establish itself as a go-to iGaming operator that can satisfy the expectations of local audiences.</p>
<p>1X2 Network is bringing the 1×2 games and Iron Dog Studios titles to the Danish operator, offering popular titles such as Gods of Asgard Megaways and Wolf Strike Hold and Win, which are now part of the experience at RoyalCasino.dk. The operator itself is the digital offshoot of Royal Casino in Aarhus, and as such, it’s a recognized brand and name in the Danish gaming sector.</p>
<p>1X2 Network also makes for a worthwhile partner in the Danish gaming market as it has already been available to local players through other brands. 1X2 went live in Denmark through a partnership with 888 signed in November 2021. As such, the supplier has been licensed and authorized to unfold its full content portfolio in one of the most heavily regulated jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Both Companies Confident in Success of Partnership</p>
<p>But the 888 partnership was just a first step, as the company also sought to double down on the Danish market, looking to capitalize on its long-term sustainability and high standards for consumer protection. 1X2 Network account management and marketing director Rory Kimber welcomed the opportunity to be present in Denmark:</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to increase our footprint in Denmark, especially with such a prestigious brand. And we look forward to showcasing our games to a whole new audience through RoyalCasino.dk. It’s an exciting market and one that has been growing each year since its establishment a decade ago. We’re just proud to be a part of it. 1X2 Network account management and marketing director Rory Kimber</p>
<p>Royal Casino head of CRM and content Jonas Madsen also spoke highly of this partnership opportunity and said that the brand is one of the biggest iGaming operators in the country. As such, RoyalCasino.dk focused on prioritizing quality, customer relationships, and responsibility. The addition of 1X2 Network games will definitely help contribute towards those stated company goals.</p>
