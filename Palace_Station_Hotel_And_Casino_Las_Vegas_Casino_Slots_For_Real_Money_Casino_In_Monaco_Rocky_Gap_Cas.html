    <h1>Palace Station Hotel And Casino Las Vegas Casino Slots For Real Money Casino In Monaco Rocky Gap Cas</h1>

<p>Well, I feel stupid for falling into this trap first of all.</p>
<p>I got a message from a guy named 'Kevin' to stream for them. I was getting $100 a stream and I was promised to keep 20% of the end balance. My first stream I managed to cashout $1000 so I would withdrawal 200.</p>
<p>However I have never received this. Ive been promised this payout since the 17th of June and its the 6th of July already.</p>
<p>They will tell you that you are on the 'list' and that you will get paid out in 24 hours. They always ask you to trust them aswell. They also manage to close down the website after every 3 days and return a couple days later. This is due to 'upgrading the system' which seems total bullsh*t to me.</p>
<p>You can deposit all you want, but they will NEVER let you withdrawal. It will be processing for over weeks and when you contact support they will add you to the 'list' and make excuses after excuses.</p>
<p>They will also ignore you for the longest time and not even try to contact you when they are down. Its just a huge SCAM.</p>
<p>Stay away while you can and NEVER deposit it on there cause you will never get your money back ðŸ˜‰</p>
