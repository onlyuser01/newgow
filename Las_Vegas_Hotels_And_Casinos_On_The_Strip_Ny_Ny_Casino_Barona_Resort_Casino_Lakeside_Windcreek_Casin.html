<p>SOFTSWISS, a leading provider of iGaming solutions and technology, has issued a new report in which the company studied the level of satisfaction that partner businesses showed with the company’s dedicated casino platform. The period covered in the report spans the months from July through October this year and it helps guide the company’s strategy and deliver on tailored solutions for the needs of partners.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS has been hailed for its ability to promptly resolve tech issues and its ability to remain flexible while negotiating business-specific needs. Among the things that clients were particularly happy with was the "top level of service" and the simplified process of communication with managers responsible for particular accounts.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS also produced a detailed list in which it took stock of what the most important attributes of iGaming leaders were. The infographic provided a comparison between 2021 and 2022 and what has changed when it comes to businesses choosing an iGaming casino platform.</p>
<p>This year, factors such as flexibility and attentiveness increased dramatically to 93%. A near-unanimous preference was given to the "provision of top service level." Overall, SOFTSWISS used nine factors to better understand what clients wanted the most.</p>
<p>There was a notable increase across all categories, including "payment systems management" and "supported currencies." The company has long been a pioneer in the provision of innovative payment options such as cryptocurrencies, making it one of the most important factors. Game descriptions were surprisingly not as important to partners in 2022.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS sought to particularly understand how its partners perceived the company based on these criteria and performance markets. The vast majority of SOFTSWISS partners gave the company feedback ranging from 7-10 points on a 10-point scale. However, 14% of respondents reported an overall score below 7 demonstrating that SOFTSWISS still has some catching up to do. Overall, though, SOFTSWISS’ casino platform posted 7.6 out of 10 performances, or a 0.2 points improvement compared to 2021.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS Casino Platform HeadDarya Avtukhovich hailed the performance and said that SOFTSWISS has already launched close to 400 successful projects over the past months. The number of highly satisfied operators has also increased, she noted, adding that the team remains as motivated as ever to create new top-performing experiences and breakthrough products.</p>
<p>SOFTSWISS also managed to outperform competitors, the company said, when looking at particular solutions such as the level of support. SOFTSWISS Chief Marketing Officer Valentina Bagniya welcomed the results and reminded us that in order to retain a leadership position, SOFTWSISS would need to continue delivering strong future-proof solutions that allow the company to stay competitive and ahead of the bend.</p>
