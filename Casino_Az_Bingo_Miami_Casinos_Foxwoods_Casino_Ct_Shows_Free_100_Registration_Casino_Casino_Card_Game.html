    <h1>Casino Az Bingo Miami Casinos Foxwoods Casino Ct Shows Free 100 Registration Casino Casino Card Game</h1>

<p>The grand prize from the popular American lottery game has been growing steadily for nearly two months</p>
<p>The last time a lucky lottery player hit the jackpot from Powerball was back in October. At the time, one incredibly lucky person from California hit the grand prize, a staggering $1.76 billion. This jackpot represented Powerball’s second-largest prize, surpassed only by the mind-blowing $2.04 billion jackpot that was won last year in November.</p>
<p>Now, a month and a half since the last time a jackpot from Powerball was won, the grand prize continues to grow. The latest drawing from Monday, November 27, 2023, saw no one guess correctly all white numbers, 2, 21, 38, 61 and 66, along with the red Powerball, 22.</p>
<p>This enabled the jackpot from the popular lottery game to continue growing. Ahead of the upcoming drawing scheduled for Wednesday, November 29, 2023, the grand prize from Powerball is estimated at $374 million. If a player guesses correctly all white numbers along with the red Powerball number, they can also select a lump cash sum that would be an estimated $173.5 million for the drawing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Besides Powerball, the jackpot from Mega Millions has also been growing steadily. With the next drawing set for Tuesday, November 28, 2023, at 11 PM ET, the estimated jackpot from Mega Millions is $335 million. Similarly to Powerball, the lottery game offers a cash option which is estimated at $153.1 million.</p>
<p>Not a Single Million-Dollar Prize Won on Monday</p>
<p>The most recent Powerball draw saw more than 327,000 people collect the lowest tier prize of $4 each. On the other hand, more than 107,000 players collected a Power Play prize of $8 each.</p>
<p>As noted, there was no lucky lottery player who guessed correctly all winning numbers to secure the jackpot prize. What’s surprising is that no one guessed correctly all five white balls. If someone had guessed the five white balls, they would’ve secured a $1 million prize. Similarly, there was no lucky winner who collected the drawing’s $2 million Power Play prize.</p>
<p>Nine lucky lottery players took home a $50,000 prize each for guessing correctly four white balls along with the red Powerball. Two lucky players paid $1 extra for the game’s Power Play option which granted them a $100,000 prize each.</p>
<p>The overall odds of securing a prize from Powerball are 1 in 24.9. The chances of securing the game’s jackpot are far slimmer or 1 in 292.2 million.</p>
