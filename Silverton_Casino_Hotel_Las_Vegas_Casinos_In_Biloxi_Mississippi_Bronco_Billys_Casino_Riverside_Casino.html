    <h1>Silverton Casino Hotel Las Vegas Casinos In Biloxi Mississippi Bronco Billys Casino Riverside Casino</h1>

<p>I signed up at Slotsberlin.com in March 2022 and claimed a bonus. I played different games over a few days. In the end I won almost 4000 EUR playing Gonzos Quest and this with the maximum bet with an active bonus of 5.00 EUR per spin.</p>
<p>I also met the wagering requirement (mine was x45 ).</p>
<p>In the end I kept playing and ultimately made a payout of EUR 3000.00.</p>
<p>This was on 4/3/2022.</p>
<p>I carried out the identity check that had to be made before the payment.</p>
<p>According to their terms and conditions, the payment is made in 48 hours.</p>
<p>The payout email says 7-21 business days. That these are now elapsedâ€¦. ðŸ˜Š well.</p>
<p>I have very funny chats with chat people (funny is ironic). Actually, you always only get the standard answers.</p>
<p>Once, without logging in, I asked in the chat whether the entries on the Internet about you being a scammer were correct. The answer was that I shouldn't believe it. Everything is correct with them.</p>
<p>I then asked how long it takes to pay out. The response was a maximum of 21 business days.</p>
<p>Then I asked with my e-mail address to look after my payout. It got quiet in the chat and in the end it was just a standard answer.</p>
