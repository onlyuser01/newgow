    <h1>Alliante Casino Casino Jobs Las Vegas Hotel In Tunica For Casinos Casinos In South Lake Tahoe Casino</h1>

<p>I made a 414 euro deposit at live-bet on 3/14/2023. I played with a bonus and completed the wagering requirements. I submitted my ID, proof of address and proof of payment and it was accepted.</p>
<p>The problem I am facing that is preventing me from withdrawing my funds is that the casino wants proof of owner for the phone number I have signed up with. It has proven impossible for me to fulfil their request as the sim card was bought from a street vendor and my phone was subsequently stolen with the aforementioned sim card.</p>
<p>They insist that their Ts and Cs state that this "phone number verification" is a requirement and it's stated in their Ts and Cs.</p>
<p>I have gone through the terms and have found no mention of this.</p>
<p>I have asked them to show me where it states this and they have gone silent on me.</p>
<p>Is the casino really justified in keeping my 850 euros because of this?</p>
