<p>Greentube, the NOVOMATIC Digital Gaming and Entertainment division, has acquired a controlling stake in Alteatec, a provider of management system and platform for the iGaming industry</p>
<p>This acquisition is executed through Greentube Austria, which will now be able to leverage the services and products offered by the company.</p>
<p>Greentube to Drive Synergies with Alteatec’s Products</p>
<p>Greentube will leverage Alteatec’s products and offer to enhance its own B2B capabilities and deliver a better and stronger overall iGaming management and technology experience through the Olympus One product.</p>
<p>Alteatec brings other worthwhile additions to the Greentube library, including live dealer streaming and voiceover technology, which are significant assets that will continue to deliver an enhanced live casino gaming experience as Greentube seeks to secure its place in a highly-contested vertical.</p>
<p>Alteatec has more solutions to offer as well, including the Alteatec Safe Server for even further synergies. Greentube is confident that by combining its own technological offer and full-stake with innovative product solutions as Novo Unity by Alteatec, the company stands to deliver a 360-degree tech stack that will help boost Greentube’s overall offer.</p>
<p>Greentube similarly hails Olympus One for its Bonus Engine, Duel Tournaments, and more gamification features that can be implemented both in online operations as well as land-based properties. As part of the latest business deal, Greentube CEO Thomas Graf and COO Georg Gubo will become managing directors at Alteatec, and support the current managing director, Christian Sael.</p>
<p>Greentube CEO’s Graf was happy with the development, and he said that it was an important and momentous start to the new year. Alteatec, he explained, was a leading iGaming technology provider, that will drive Greentube’s product forward significantly.</p>
<p>Management Happy with a Momentums Opportunity</p>
<p>Alteatec’s Sael was similarly chuffed with this new opportunity. He hailed the arrival of Greentube as a company that hardly needed any introduction and said that the most recent deal was an honor.</p>
<p>“We’re all incredibly excited about this partnership and we can’t wait to get to work, delivering all the services we’re recognized for in order to help the company grow,” Sael concluded. Greentube’s COO, Gubo, added that Alteatec’s technology will only help the company continue to grow and reach the next level of its development.</p>
