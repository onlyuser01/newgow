    <h1>Aquarius Hotel Casino Borgata Casino In Atlantic City Desert Diamond Casino Tucson Goldie S Casino C</h1>

<p>Hello carsix79,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint and I'm really sorry to hear about your issue with Terrybet Casino. Please allow me to ask you a few more question before we would move forward.</p>
<p>When exactly did you request to close your account? Did they mention in any way that you won't be able to reopen your account.</p>
<p>For now we consider cooling off period a tool which can be canceled anytime if the player requests for it. It is not even mandatory for the casino to have such a tool and if the player wishes to reopen his account, he can do it anytime.</p>
<p>Unfortunately if you did so and lost the balance there isn't much we can do as you lost it fairly.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your answer.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Nick</p>
