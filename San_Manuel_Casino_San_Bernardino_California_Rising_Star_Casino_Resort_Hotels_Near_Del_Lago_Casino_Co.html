    <h1>San Manuel Casino San Bernardino California Rising Star Casino Resort Hotels Near Del Lago Casino Co</h1>

<p>Relax Gaming, an established B2B iGaming provider and aggregator, will power Meridian Gaming with slot games. Thanks to that deal, the former company will foray into the Serbian market.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming to Launch in Serbia</p>
<p>Through this deal, Relax Gaming’s titles will be launched in the 15 regulated markets where Meridian Gaming’s content is licensed. The operator boasts over 1000 retail shops across those jurisdictions which will greatly extend Relax’s footprint. The agreement will also expand the aggregator’s reach to Serbia, giving the local bettors the first taste of Relax Gaming’s premium content.</p>
<p>Meridian Gaming users will be able to try out some of Relax Gaming’s most tempting titles, including but not limited to Beast Mode, Money Train 2, and Temple Tumble.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming currently offers over 3,000 iGaming titles to its clients. Some of those are proprietary games made by the company’s own developers, while others come from its reliable partners. Meridian Gaming will receive extra content from the supplier’s partners, which number more than 50.</p>
<p>The mutually beneficial deal will help both companies with their differentiation efforts. Meridian will receive Relax’s premium content while the latter will increase its presence in European markets.</p>
<p>Meridian Gaming Is Delighted to Add Relax’s Games</p>
<p>Milan Djurmez, the head of online casino for Meridian Gaming, commented on the deal and welcomed the addition of Relax’s innovative slot content to his company’s offerings. Djurmez is happy by the opportunity to provide Meridian’s customers with engaging content and is excited to see how the players will react to those “groundbreaking titles.”</p>
<p>Nadiya Attard, the chief commercial officer of Relax Gaming, said that the supplier’s team is thrilled to launch in Serbia and supply Meridian across numerous jurisdictions. Attard added that this deal corresponds to Relax’s vision for the future:</p>
<p>“This is the ideal move to ensure we continue to drive differentiation on the global stage and we look forward to a long and positive relationship with Meridian to ensure we both accomplish that.” Relax Gaming CCO Nadiya Attard</p>
<p>Alexia Smilovic Ronde, the chief regulatory officer of Relax Gaming praised the deal, emphasizing the potential of the rapidly-growing Serbian market. Ronde called the agreement “an incredibly exciting move” to both companies and is convinced that it will prove fruitful.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming is a critically-acclaimed supplier and has received numerous excellence awards. In 2021 alone, the aggregator was named ”Casino Content Supplier” at the 2021 EGR Nordic Awards and “Casino Software Supplier” and “Innovation in Mobile” at the EGR B2B 2021 Awards and received 12 more awards.</p>
