<p>The multi-year collaboration is expected to boost the exposure of women's tennis and complement the growth of women's sports</p>
<p>The leading betting and gaming company, FanDuel, announced it renewed its agreement with the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA). The latest collaboration, announced Tuesday, builds upon the success of a previous deal between the duo. Under the terms of the new multi-year agreement, FanDuel is designated as the WTA’s authorized gaming partner for the Hologic WTA Tour in North, South and Central America.</p>
<p>At the same time, the collaboration with WTA complements FanDuel’s ongoing support for the growth of women’s sports. Per the new agreement, the betting company will be able to benefit from WTA hospitality for different tournaments. At the same time, the brand will benefit from social media posts exposure throughout the season, reaching more sports fans and bettors alike.</p>
<p>Previously, FanDuel adopted video highlights of women’s tennis within its digital platforms, helping promote the popularity of the sport and at the same time, supporting its growth and expansion. This helped deliver exciting experiences and products for WTA fans. Thanks to the latest collaboration, FanDuel will continue to leverage WTA trademarks, as well as official scoring data via Stats Perform, which is designated as the Association’s official data supplier.</p>
<p>The extended deal with the WTA comes during a busy period for FanDuel. Only recently, the company confirmed it signed an agreement with the Canadian Football League (CFL). This designated FanDuel as an official sportsbook partner for the CFL.</p>
<p>FanDuel Is Delighted to Support Women in Sports</p>
<p>Clifton Ma, FanDuel’s strategic partnerships, vice president, praised the renewed partnership with the WTA. He explained that the collaboration enables the company to continue to develop new and exciting products that will boost fan engagement and deliver thrilling experiences for fans of women’s tennis.</p>
<p>Finally, Ma pointed out: “FanDuel is committed to supporting women in sports and this partnership has been a key pillar of that commitment as we’ve worked with the WTA to celebrate key women’s initiatives through unique storytelling opportunities.”</p>
<p>Late last month, a report suggested that FanDuel considers signing a deal with Churchill Downs for an entry into the sports betting market in Kentucky.</p>
<p>“Our extension with FanDuel represents the WTA’s ongoing commitment to innovation,“ Micky Lawler, president at WTA</p>
<p>Micky Lawler, WTA’s president, was similarly excited about the extended deal with FanDuel and explained that it complements the Association’s dedication to innovation. He spoke about WTA’s goal to diversify the way “fans consume and engage with sports” and at the same time said that FanDuel is the perfect partner for that objective. Finally, Lawler predicted that the collaboration will provide a boost for the exposure of women’s tennis while ensuring that fans benefit from responsible gambling.</p>
