    <h1>Legend Casino Casino In Orlando Florida Best Crypto Casinos Wild Rose Casino Santa Claran Hotel Casi</h1>

<p>I thought I would post this right away because I just caught one of the ways SlotsofVegas will try screwing new customers out of their winnings .</p>
<p>I deposited $30.00 on February 9,2023 around 2 pm. The total charge was $32.91 with the fees. I used my debit card. It was approved, I got an instant notification showing the charge to my account . I played for a few hours and ended up winning around $400. So I stopped gambling for the day. I went to try to cash out $200, and was alerted I needed to send picture of my license , debit card used and some form and even a utility bill? So I did all this and went to bed .</p>
<p>On February 10th I logged into my account and noticed my account was $105 shorter than I remembered? I began playing the slots on there , went up and down for a while then I won about $3,000 more. Bringing my balance to around $3400.00. I decided to stop and look into what was going on with my verification and my account missing $100 from earlier. This is what I found out…</p>
<p>I saw in my transaction history my debit card deposit of $30 was approved at 2:20 on Feb 8 th and my $75 bonus was also approved . I had won $8 in some free spins around 2:50 I think and this was credited THEN at 7:18 am A uncollected debit card deposit collection was requested BY THEM on Feb 10th also a $75 bonus collection request was requested by them .</p>
<p>So what they did was decided to return or void my debit card deposit from the day before and just deduct it from my account balance , and not say ANYTHING to me this way they can now say there was an issue with my deposit . I spoke with my bank , the transaction was cancelled by the merchant , meaning SlotsofVegas purposefully chose to not process the debit card transaction , and instead just take $105 from my account ! When they do this there will be no history of this transaction on bank statements . It vanishes. They ONLY DID THIS BECAUSE I WON, now if I would have lost they would have kept accepting my Debit Card deposits over and over and over , until I won . Then if I won enough they would deduct them again, or they would wait the full 5 business days before collecting the pending debit card transactions .</p>
<p>SlotsofVegas is now telling me they need history of this transaction on my statement pretending they didn’t cancel it. It is my banks policy to not do ANYTHING with pending transactions for 5 business days. My bank told me the merchant (SlotsofVegas) chose to return it. My bank is going to contact me Monday and see if they can find the transaction number</p>
<p>You can see all the transactions here from my SlotsofVegas account.</p>
<p>It clearly says on my account type: Depositor</p>
<p>If you use a debit card to deposit on their website and let’s pretend you don’t have the $ in your account , it doesn’t matter because your bank approved the transaction so they are covering the transaction . THATS NOT WHAT HAPPENED IN MY CASE I had plenty of money, the transaction was approved , and SlotsofVegas credited me with my deposit , let me play , the saw that I had won $, and jumped on the opportunity to just take the money from my account and cancel the transaction so if I tried to withdraw money at a later date they could refuse the request and cite that I can’t provide proof of my initial deposit . ABSOLUTE CROOKS.</p>
