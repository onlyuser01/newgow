    <h1>Osage Casino Skiatook Casino Texas Plaza Casino Las Vegas Casino In Shawnee Ok Wisconsin Casino Map</h1>

<p>They had a Christmas free spin deal for depositors. I got 25mbtc . As I always do, I double checked with them to make sure I had the play back rules correct because they weren't available on the page about the free spins. I was told I had to play it through three times and then twice and then not at all. Come to find out, there's no play through and I ended up playing back about $500 bucks of a win. After I complained I was lied to and told for me only there's no play through the rest of the days of the free spins and was given 10 free spins make up for the huge loss. Of course I was not happy and they didn't give me anything to fix the issue, outside of ten free spins that weren't worth anything in the ballpark. I was told if I complained publicly they would delete my account. I told them I am feeling bamboozled and taken advantage of because I was very aware that there was in fact no play through requirements for the free spins. I was lied to repeatedly as a result of not being happy about the huge loss. Nothing has been done to rectify the situation still so I'm here asking you guys for your help to get my winnings back or at least make this situation known. I have all the screenshots to prove the habitual lying and pack of caring to fix the issue. Chile is too large to attach.</p>
