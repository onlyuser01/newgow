<p>HEROS, an Oxford-based retraining stable, agreed to power the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) with new equine welfare programs. The stable will provide retired racehorses with the care they need.</p>
<p>HEROS Will Retrain Retiring Horses</p>
<p>HEROS was founded by Grace Muir who now serves as the company CEO. The stable provides expert care to race-trained horses and helps them to get used to life after their retirement.</p>
<p>As BHA’s partner, HEROS will provide the authority with best-in-class programs for any thoroughbred horses that retire from racing. The retraining company will help the animals recover and will retrain race-trained horses.</p>
<p>After a horse has been retrained and approved for rehoming, it will be time to find it a new home. Retraining of Racehorses (RoR), a charity working with HEROS, will be responsible for these matters. RoR will leverage its network to make sure each horse ends up with an appropriate new owner.</p>
<p>At a later date, BHA will release a retirement assessment and tracking tool to make finding former racehorses a new home even easier. The collaboration between BHA and HEROS is a part of UK Racing’s overall equine welfare initiatives.</p>
<p>Dedication to the Horses’ Wellbeing</p>
<p>Philip Freedman, chairman of RoR, noted that the new collaboration comes as a result of the continuous growth in the demand for thoroughbred horses among the equestrian community. He called this a “very positive development” and pointed out that RoR continues to play a large role in this tendency. The charity organization, as noted by Freedman, continues to seek opportunities for former racehorses and to provide education measures for their riders.</p>
<p>Barry Johnson, chairman of the Horse Welfare Board, spoke about the so-called “The Life Well Lived” strategy. He shared that it was created to ensure that thoroughbred horses are receiving the best care throughout their whole lives.</p>
<p>This new agreed definition of racing’s responsibility means we can now expand the sport’s safety net to ensure a smooth transition out of racing for any horse bred for racing. This is about providing a safe space for thoroughbreds that may need additional support via an industry-backed organization with first-class experience and facilities.

<p>It should also be noted that new retraining accreditation standards are expected to launch by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Speaking about racing, the Racing League just announced that it will continue working with William Hill throughout the 2022 season.</p>
