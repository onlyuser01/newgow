<p>Vending Machine review</p>
<p>Vending Machine takes players on a late- night excursion for junk food.</p>
<p>By the light of the moon, a young woman and a cat hang out by an enticing vending machine. A variety of snacks are available, including candies, sodas, and icy treats.</p>
<p>Vending Machine is perfect for players who want a peaceful vibe.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>The titular vending machine contains the reels where a range of foods and beverages hover. Packs of gum, juice boxes, hard candies, and slices of bread all make an appearance among the symbols.</p>
<p>A young woman with bobbed hair leans against the vending machine. She has a quiet charisma as she holds a book under her arm and looks down into the glow of her phone.</p>
<p>On the other side of the reels, a gray cat sits on a railing, gently twitching his tail. He stares out at the moonlit cityscape, but seems to be in no hurry to leave his comfortable perch.</p>
<p>The soundtrack has an ethereal, retro feel with a meandering melody and soulful saxophone solos. The slots spin with a clink, followed by slurping and crunching sounds during wins.</p>
<p>The graphics and soundtrack blend to create a uniquely calming slot.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Vending Machine is a five- reel, five- row slot, with 35 win lines.</p>
<p>The Cascade feature means that winning symbols vanish, making way for new symbols to fall from above to replace them. If a Cascade concludes and no more wins are available, the Remove &amp; Cascade feature may be triggered, removing all low-paying symbols from the reels. This will allow new symbols to fall into the newly available space.</p>
<p>The maximum win is 5,000x of the player’s total bet.</p>
<p>Gameplay video</p>
<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all symbols on the paytable.</p>
<p>An inactive multiplier is shown on the left of each row. The value of these multipliers is assigned at random at the start of every spin, ranging from 2x to 10x. After a winning combination, the multiplier on every row containing a winning symbol increases. Each winning symbol prompts a multiplier increase of 1.</p>
<p>A Multiplier Boost Scatter symbol has the power to increase the multiplier of its row by 2. Meanwhile, the Epic Multiplier Boost Scatter multiplies every row multiplier by 2.</p>
<p>Lightning Bolt Scatter symbols have the special ability to activate the multiplier of the row where they land. When at least one winning symbol is located on the activated row, the multiplier is applied to the entire win.</p>
<p>Row multipliers may only be applied once to a winning combination, even if more than one winning symbol appears in that row.</p>
<p>Blackout Skulls have the ability to deactivate the multiplier of the row where they land.</p>
<p>When players land 3 FS Scatter symbols, the Low-Fi Spins feature begins. During this feature, 3-row multipliers are activated, and the feature continues until each one has been deactivated.</p>
<p>Landing 4 FS Scatter symbols triggers the Spin and Chill feature. This feature begins with 5-row multipliers active, and the feature continues until all multipliers are deactivated.</p>
<p>Bet Sizes, RTP and Variance</p>
<p>The return to player of this game is 96.28%, slightly above our yardstick for an average of roughly 96%.</p>
<p>The range of bets on the site we tested ran from a minimum bet per spin of $/£/€0.10 up to a maximum of $/£/€100 per spin.</p>
<p>With medium volatility, the Vending Machine is a less ideal match for our preferred slot machine strategies. We suggest a strategy of seeking the highest possible volatility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We recommend this high RTP, medium volatility vending machine-themed slot.</p>
<p>With creative bonuses and a completely relaxing vibe, Vending Machine is well-worth checking out. Although the RTP is decent, mathematically-inclined players may be less enticed by the moderate volatility.</p>
