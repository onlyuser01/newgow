<p>Apparat Gaming, a German iGaming content developer, has joined Pariplay’s Ignite program. The move will help the ambitious studio reach more markets and expand its footprint.</p>
<p>Pariplay Will Ignite Apparat</p>
<p>By joining Pariplay, Apparat Gaming will be able to use the former’s flexible turnkey development framework and distribute its games in many regulated jurisdictions. Thanks to Pariplay’s fusion aggregation platform, the studio has more potential than ever before.</p>
<p>In addition, the partnership with Pariplay will allow the German studio to use the aggregator’s state-of-the-art back-office and engagement tools. This will further provide Apparat with all the tools it needs to become a true powerhouse in its sector.</p>
<p>Apparat Is Happy to Join the Program</p>
<p>Callum Harris, the director of partnerships for Pariplay, commented on the deal. He said that his company is proud to expand its Ignite program and help Apparat hit the ground running. Harris is sure the studio has the potential to deliver unique and exciting content and is happy to provide it with what it needs to grow.</p>
<p>In Apparat Gaming, we have found a studio partner that delivers high-quality, reliable and fun titles that are already trusted by operators in Germany and other European markets, and we look forward to working together to further propel their growth and product delivery. Callum Harris, director of partnerships, Pariplay</p>
<p>Alina Dandörfer, Apparat Gaming’s co-founder and director also shared her thoughts she is glad by how far Apparat has become and is looking forward to taking the studio’s content to the next level. To that end, becoming an Ignite partner will do wonders and help Apparat find the support it needs.</p>
<p>Our mission is to deliver iGaming content with a German accent, and we can’t wait to introduce our titles to a wider audience through this partnership with Pariplay. Alina Dandörfer, co-founder and director, Apparat Gaming</p>
<p>iGaming with a German Accent</p>
<p>Apparat Gaming was founded in 2020. The company seeks to deliver iGaming content that is clearly German. Therefore, Apparat’s games are high in quality, reliable and have a committed team that backs them. In addition, they lack all sense of humor, the company jokes.</p>
<p>Apparat fields a team with years of prior experience in the gambling industry and is keen on delivering supreme iGaming content with a German accent. The company has previously released two games, Pharaoh Princess and Fruit Storm. A week ago, the studio unveiled yet another title, called Total Eclipse and has one more planned for the month.</p>
