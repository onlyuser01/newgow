<p>The three casinos in Detroit recorded slight revenue declines and are lagging behind their May 2022 results</p>
<p>The Michigan Gaming Control Board posted an update on the performance of the three Detroit casinos in May. The overall revenue experienced a slight decline.</p>
<p>The regulator noted that the three casinos earned a total of $105.6 million in monthly aggregate revenue. The MGM casino performed the best out of the three, posting a market share of 47%. MotorCity was second with 31%, followed by Hollywood Casino at Greektown with 22%.</p>
<p>Table games and slots were responsible for most of the total revenue ($104.7 million). This represents a slight 1.4% year-on-year decrease and a 4.5% month-on-month decrease.</p>
<p>Despite being last in terms of overall market share, Hollywood Casino at Greektown was the only property to record an increase in monthly gaming revenue. The property posted revenue of $23.3 million, up 7.4% from May 2022.</p>
<p>MGM, on the other hand, experienced a 1.4% decline to $49.3 million. Meanwhile, MotorCity’s revenue plummeted to $32.1 million, which translates to a decline of 7.1%.</p>
<p>The State of Michigan collected a total of $8.5 million in taxes from the three casinos, which is a very slight decrease from the $8.6 million they paid in May 2022. In addition, the properties submitted $12.5 million in betting taxes and development agreement payments to the City of Detroit.</p>
<p>Sports Betting and Fantasy Sports Are Still Lagging Behind Casino Gaming</p>
<p>Retail sports betting recorded revenue of under a million ($893,732). The disparity between the casino and betting revenues is in line with the trends recorded in February.</p>
<p>The revenue came from a sports betting handle of $16,936,055. Total gross receipts, the Michigan Gaming Control Board added, were $921,268.</p>
<p>Qualified adjusted gross receipts (QAGR) were up $773,382 from April but 62.6% down on May 2022. MGM outranked its competitors in terms of QAGR, posting $470,510, followed by MotorCity and Hollywood Casino at Greektown with $395,677 and $27,545 respectively.</p>
<p>These retail betting results translated into taxes of $33.783 to the state and $41,290 to the City of Detroit.</p>
<p>Finally, the Michigan Gaming Control Board reported that fantasy sports operators reported total adjusted revenues of $2.1 million. They also paid $175,204 in taxes.</p>
<p>The regulator concluded that from January 1 through April 30, fantasy contest operators reported $8.9 million in aggregate adjusted revenues. They have, so far, paid $747,830 in taxes.</p>
<p>The revenue of Detroit’s casinos has been fluctuating and experiencing periodical changes.</p>
