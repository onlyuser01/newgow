    <h1>Real Money Online Casino California Aria Casino Las Vegas Ceasers Casino Poseidon Casino Vegas Casin</h1>

<p>Wheel of Legends, the multi-game product owned by Zitro, has been brought to Grupo Gran Madrid’s Casino Torrelodones. This development comes off the heels of Zitro’s expansion in Switzerland, as the studio’s Altius Glare cabinets were supplied to Casino Barrière.</p>
<p>Zitro’s Multi-Game Was Welcomed With Open Hands</p>
<p>While commenting on the latest addition at Grupo Gran Madrid’s Casino Torrelodones, the property’s head of product retail, Sergio Rupérez, noted that the casino is delighted to be working together with Zitro and provide customers with “high-quality content.”</p>
<p>He added that Wheel of Legends and the Altius Glare cabinet provide an immersive gaming experience at Casino Torrelodones and hence, customers will be in for a massive treat.</p>
<p>Jaime Aníbal-Álvarez, the director of casinos Spain at Zitro, also shared a few words on the partnership. He stated that everyone at Zitro is confident that the Wheel of Legends multi-game will be a great addition to the portfolio of Casino Gran Madrid.</p>
<p>He also added that Zitro is grateful that Casino Gran Madrid has given the company the opportunity to provide it with the best products and achieve great results in all three casinos owned by the group – Casino Colón, Casino Torrequebrada, and Casino Torrelodones.</p>
<p>Just before the Madrid expansion Zitro’s Wheel of Legends was added at Casino de Mallorca, along with a few other products by the company. The managers at Casino de Mallorca were thrilled with the product and stated that the reception for Wheel of Legends at the casino has been incredible.</p>
<p>Zitro Has Been on a Massive Global Expansion Mission</p>
<p>Apart from the expansion in Spain, Zitro has been focused lately on expanding its presence across Europe and the world. At the start of August, the company signed a partnership with Groupe Vikings and thus, increased its footprint in France.</p>
<p>Thanks to the partnership with Groupe Vikings, Zitro’s Wheel of Legends and 88 Link Multiplier were integrated at Bussang and Fréjus. Both of these casinos are owned by Groupe Vikings. The general director of Groupe Vikings, Christian Huby, stated back then that Zitro’s games proved to perform strongly across numerous markets and that he hopes that the partnership is the “start of a long-term collaboration.”</p>
<p>Back in June, Zitro’s footprint in LatAm was also boosted via an expanded partnership with Boldt Group. The initial terms of this deal were signed in May 2022 and they saw Zitro installing 130 slots at three casino establishments in Buenos Aires – Casino de Tandil, Casino Trilenium, and Casino del Mar.</p>
<p>Thanks to the expansion, Zitro’s offerings were also included in Santa Fe’s Casino Melincué and Casino Santa.</p>
