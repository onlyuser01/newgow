<p>Iowa welcomes BetMGM as the latest mobile app to set foot in the Hawkeye State following the lifting of the in-person account registration restriction.</p>
<p>BetMGM Sets Its Mark on Iowa with Betting App</p>
<p>BetMGM has become the latest sports betting firm to launch a dedicated mobile app in Iowa, following the state’s welcome decision to scrap in-person registration and allow consumers to access sports betting products in the manner they find best, referring to remote account setup.</p>
<p>In November, Iowa was the eighth highest state in terms of sports betting revenue, even though the state’s population is far from the largest among jurisdictions that have legalized wagering on sporting contests.</p>
<p>Despite the drawback of requesting in-person registrations, Iowa’s sports betting handle has been going steady, and the Hawkeye State has been making its mark on wagering across the country. In November, the state reported $87 million in accepted bets, a record-high number, with over 72% of all bets placed on mobile. Iowa is also planning to renegotiate tax on casinos during this legislative session.</p>
<p>Make Use of Rewards</p>
<p>The shift towards no in-person registration will likely boost these numbers and see more consumers jump at the opportunity to bet remotely. Commenting on the current success, BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt said that the company’s connection with MGM Resorts allows die-hard sports fans in the state to continue building upon new experiences.</p>
<p>Thanks to the M life Rewards, MGM Resorts’ loyalty program, sports bettors get special perks to spend on their visits to MGM properties not just potentially in Iowa, through the Diamond Jo Casino link-up, but all over the country.</p>
<p>Steady Results and Interest</p>
<p>Iowa is far behind Illinois, its neighbor, which has clocked in $200 million more than Iowa since it launched sports betting in March 2020, but Illinois is a state of 12.3 million residents whereas the Hawkeye State only has 3.2 million people.</p>
<p>With the most recent launch in Iowa, BetMGM has officially launched its sports betting app in eight states, including Nevada, New Jersey, Colorado, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and West Virginia.</p>
<p>BetMGM is hardly the only company to has taken keen interest with both William Hill and PointsBet debuting their own products.</p>
