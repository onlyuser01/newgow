    <h1>Hard Rock Social Casino Philadelphia Casino L Auberge Casino Lake Charles Hotel Qcc Casino New York</h1>

<p>1.no casino that is legit has let anyone's sign up with the exact same information as they already have in their system and won't allow people to sign up multiple times on the same email address with same name and birthdate ect so this is how they target and scam the Canadian citizens with promises of fair play and don't deliver when it comes to the withdrawal process and it's not right it's bs if you ask me</p>
<ol>
<li>They send the same promotions over and over to the same emails after and then when you click on it they basically force you to sign up with the same email and information they already have on your account so they are well aware of what they are doing and what goes on in everybody's casino rewards group accounts it's not new I've had some my accounts for years and have even received my loyalty cards mailed to me from the casino on two different accounts with my same names and addresses</li>
</ol>
<p>3.They say that I've made the accounts strictly to abuse promotions and that is a lie as they said they close my account and wiped my winnings but yet right after I got the email and I tried to sign into my casino account to talk to the rep it showed my account with $12 still in it not closed so everything they said in my email about closing my account and wiping the winnings was obviously wrong when the account can still be found</p>
<p>4.i was promised the night before as seen in the casino's chat with The representative at my winnings were processed and I would be using receiving the first $4,000 the next day which instead I woke up to the email from the risk management stating that I wasn't going to get paid due to abusing their promotions what is wrong and they should not be able to do this I've gotta person that can handle this for me I'm a little bit slower with the situations like this so I think i will hand you off to my hubby and let him deal with this as he witnessed it all happen and can explain better then what I can in this matter thanks and I am hoping to get justice where it is deserved and get what is right fully mine . I suffer from PTSD and anxiety and panic disorder and have a hard time with things like this and don't really know how to handle or bring up this kinda thing properly so in that regards I'll hand this off to my wonderful husband and let him handle it from here thanks all this stress this has caused me is very bad for my PTSD and anxiety so I will let him handle this from now on it's on his hands thanks for hearing my side the story first though Jennifer</p>
