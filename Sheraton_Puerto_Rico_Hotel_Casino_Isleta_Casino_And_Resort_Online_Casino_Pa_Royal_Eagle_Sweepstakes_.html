    <h1>Sheraton Puerto Rico Hotel Casino Isleta Casino And Resort Online Casino Pa Royal Eagle Sweepstakes</h1>

<p>Hard Rock International and Seminole Gaming’s joint venture offering interactive gaming and sports betting, Hard Rock Digital, announced its mobile app launch into the regulated market in Arizona.</p>
<p>Sports Fans in Arizona Can Now Enjoy a New Sportsbook App</p>
<p>The launch of the all-new Hard Rock Sportsbook mobile app in the Grand Canyon State is the result of collaboration with the Navajo Nation Gaming Enterprise (NNGE). Initially, Hard Rock Digital secured market access to the state by inking a deal with the NNGE back in January.</p>
<p>Now, the duo celebrates the launch of the new mobile app that offers betting for major sports events. Moreover, the Hard Rock Sportsbook mobile sportsbook app offers best-in-class customer support and unique promotions. Sports fans age 21 and over can enjoy wagering on live events, same-game parlays as well as innovative rewarding features. Currently, the mobile sportsbook app is available for both Android and iOS devices. To download the app the bettors would need to be physically located in Arizona.</p>
<p>Launched in September last year, the mobile sports betting market has been gradually growing in Arizona. Back in December, sportsbooks in the state came close to the $500-million sports betting handle milestone but couldn’t achieve it. However, in January, sportsbooks in Arizona reported strong revenue. The market soared and the sports betting handle of the sportsbooks hit $560 million.</p>
<p>The Launch Marks an Exciting Moment for NNGE, Hard Rock</p>
<p>NNGE’s interim CEO, Brian Parrish, acknowledged that Navajo Gaming is proud and pleased to join forces with Hard Rock Digital. He explained that Hard Rock is a world-renowned brand and its application combines quality and functionality that in turn create new opportunities for the NNGE.</p>
<p>“The quality and functionality of the mobile platform is outstanding, and we are anticipating great opportunities to cross-market the Navajo Nation Gaming Enterprise (NNGE) with a premiere gaming-hospitality operator and the world-renowned Hard Rock brand.” Brian Parrish, interim CEO at the NNGE</p>
<p>Currently, the NNGE operates a travel plaza as well as four casinos in Arizona and New Mexico. The NNGE is a Navajo Nation wholly-owned business that was created back in September 2006. By now, the NNGE has more than 1,200 employees.</p>
<p>“Arizona has a rich sports culture and we’re proud to enter the state with our great partners at Navajo Gaming.” Marlon Goldstein, executive managing director and CEO at Hard Rock Digital</p>
<p>HRD’s executive managing director and CEO, Marlon Goldstein, revealed that the company is proud to enter Arizona by joining forces with Navajo Gaming. He explained that Hard Rock is excited to debut its new platform that is easy to use and suitable for experienced bettors as well as casual sports fans. In conclusion, Goldstein said that offering the best service is one of Hard Rock’s commitments that will help the brand “stand out in this competitive market.”</p>
