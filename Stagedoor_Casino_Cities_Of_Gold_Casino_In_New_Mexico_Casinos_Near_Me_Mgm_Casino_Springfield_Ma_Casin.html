<p>Bryson DeChambeau Takes Commanding FedEx Cup Lead at Playoffs Halfway Point</p>

<p>After Bryson DeChambeau won the first two legs of the 2018 FedEx Cup Playoffs, the 24-year-old stands tall in a dominating position at the halfway mark.</p>

<p>With just the BMW Championship and TOUR Championship remaining, DeChambeau is atop the playoff leaderboard with 5,617 points. Dustin Johnson is his nearest competitor at 3,289 points.</p>
<p>DeChambeau is unquestionably the hottest player in golf. He won by four at The Northern Trust Open, and followed it up with a back-to-back win on Labor Day by taking the Dell Technologies Championship by two stokes.</p>
<p>Prior to the Dell, the Westgate SuperBook had DeChambeau at 8/1 to win the FedEx Cup Playoffs. That line has been slashed in half after his Monday victory.</p>
<p>Overcoming Odds</p>
<p>Few could have predicted the strong play from DeChambeau, but those who did and put money on it are being handsomely rewarded.</p>
<p>DeChambeau’s four previous tournaments before the FedEx Cup Playoffs teed off went WD due to a shoulder injury (John Deere Classic) T51 (Open Championship), 30 (WGC-Bridgestone Invitational), and a missed cut (PGA Championship). Not exactly the typical tell-tale signs that a player’s about to unleash a barrage of birdies.</p>
<p>Heading into The Northern Trust, Bryson wasn’t a frontrunner to emerge victorious. In fact, he began the tournament at 80/1, or implied odds of 1.23 percent. A $100 wager on those odds net those fortunate enough to make the gamble $8,000.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have written it any better, to be honest with you,” DeChambeau said Monday. “I’ve been playing some great golf this whole year, and I knew it was a matter of time before something cool showed up.”</p>
<p>Bettors who hopped on the DeChambeau train following The Northern Trust were again paid well. While Dustin Johnson (8/1), Justin Thomas (10/1), and US Open and PGA Champion Brooks Koepka (12/1) were the odds-on favorites, Bryson entered the second leg of the playoffs at a distant 30/1. A $100 bet on those odds returned $3,000.</p>
<p>Points Reset</p>
<p>Ahead by more than 2,300 points on Johnson, and the winner of the final two events each receiving 2,000 points, DeChambeau is in a strong position to cap off the FedEx Cup and win the $10 million grand prize. However, the top five players entering the Tour Championship control their own destiny should they win at East Lake.</p>
<p>Before the finale, the 30 qualifying players will be reseeded based. The No. 1 player will enter with 2,000 points, while the last man in will have just 115.</p>
<p>The top five control their own destiny because the No. 5 player ahead of the Tour Championship will retain 1,280 points. With 2,000 points given to the winner of the final playoff event, even if the No. 1 player finishes second at East Lake (which awards 1,200 points), the No. 5 player will conclude the series with 3,280 points to the No. 1 player’s 3,200.</p>
<p>Dustin Johnson will look to make up ground on DeChambeau this week at the BMW. DJ has won the event twice, and enters at 9/1 to win.</p>
