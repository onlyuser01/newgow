<p>I reviewed the whole case and I am afraid that we are not able to support you further. Although we believe that once a player clearly indicates a gambling problem, the casino team should take appropriate steps (restrict the user accounts and do an assessment with the player, etc.) or close the player's account as soon as possible, we must also take into consideration that you created all accounts using different email addresses. Since the casino offers quick registration without providing any personal details and verification isn't required at the point of registration, your email address was the only personal detail that could indicate you already had another account.</p>
<p>Of course, we would like to see every casino not allow players to open new accounts when they have previously closed their accounts due to gambling problems, but many casinos usually engage in a verification check prior to a withdrawal, so it is only then that they check all relevant information and find out about any restrictions for a certain player.</p>
<p>I can agree with you that the casino could have set its responsible gaming and self-exclusion measures more strictly, but this is not an industry standard and there are no self-exclusion or responsible gambling tools rules applied universally to all online casinos.</p>
<p>Your latest account (and most likely all other related accounts) was closed per your request, and the creation of other accounts was solely your responsibility. Unfortunately, at this point, there is not much that can be done in regard to the funds you have deposited and lost in the casino.</p>
<p>I can only recommend that you contact the licensing authority as they have better tools and options to help players and they are able to investigate such cases more thoroughly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I strongly advise that you seek Professional Help with Gambling Addiction. You can find Gambling Help Centers for your location here and another recommendation is to use Apps and tools to block access to gambling at a global level that you can find here.</p>
<p>Due to the aforementioned reasons, this complaint will now be rejected. Thank you for your understanding, I am sorry we could not be of more help on this occasion. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you run into any issues with this or any other casino in the future.</p>
