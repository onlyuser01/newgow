<p>BetMGM has signed a multi-year partnership with Kansas City Chief on the occasion of the team’s home state soft-launching sports betting on Thursday. The collaboration will see BetMGM recognized as the Official Sports Betting Partner for the NFL franchise.</p>
<p>Kansas City Chiefs Welcome Sports Betting Legalization with BetMGM</p>
<p>The deal will involve intellectual property and social media collaborations, such as BetMGM’s logo which will now be visible at GEHA Field, the Kansas City Chiefs’ home stadium, and their social media, along with other advertisement media.</p>
<p>The BetMGM’s branding and intellectual property will be visible during Chiefs’ games and across the social media channels, with a number of giveaway prize pools and game-day experiences for fans who are watching from home or attending events in person. This partnership was hailed by BetMGM CRO Matt Prevos:</p>
<p>With a rich history and a passionate fan base, the Kansas City Chiefs are an ideal partner. As we launch our sports betting platform in Kansas, we look forward to elevating the game-day experience for Chiefs fans throughout the region.</p>
<p>The team has been equally pleased with the partnership and what it signifies for the team. Mark Donovan, president of the Kansas City Chiefs, added that BetMGM has an important place to play with Chiefs Kingdom, the usual name ascribed to the sports team’s fans.</p>
<p>Donovan said that the team has invested time and resources to make sports betting legal in the Sunflower State and is now prepared to collaborate with the best companies in the sector. This is going to be the first NFL season in which sports gambling is legal in Kansas. The industry launched on Thursday as part of a “soft-launch” experience and is due to launch fully next week.</p>
<p>Both BetMGM and Chiefs Are Excited about Legalized Sports Gambling</p>
<p>BetMGM has been building up a strong partnership with sports teams and leagues across North America. The betting and gaming giant is partners with both the Canadian and American NFL and it has established partnerships with numerous NFL franchises.</p>
<p>BetMGM has also joined American Gaming Association’s campaign for Responsible Gambling Education Month in September, hoping to boost safe gambling and betting practices among new and established fans.</p>
