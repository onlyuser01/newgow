<p>The deal will initially center on the UK and Ireland but can be expanded to include racing content from more regions</p>
<p>Spotlight Sports Group, a global leader in sports tech, media and content, has unveiled a new agreement with XL Media, another leading media company. Under the deal between the two media giants, SSG will provide its new partner with premium horseracing content.</p>
<p>SSG to Power XL Media Via Superfeed</p>
<p>SSG will leverage its Superfeed content engine to integrate content for some of the most popular racing events into some of XL Media’s most popular domains. The agreement will see the content delivered through a custom-built widget. What will follow is a full API integration across all domains.</p>
<p>At first, the partnership will center on content from horse races in the United Kingdom and Ireland. However, the agreement can be further expanded to include racing content for many other regions. Thanks to Superfeed, adding more territories to the agreement would be easy and seamless.</p>
<p>In addition to making the integration smooth for both companies, Superfeed provides content in more than 80 languages. This would allow XL Media to serve all the markets it desires.</p>
<p>Superfeed racing content is based on robust and reliable racing data with the solution analyzing more than 60,000 races each year.</p>
<p>Both Parties Are Thrilled</p>
<p>Darren Hale, XL Media’s director of commercial partnerships, commented on the agreement. He noted that he is looking forward to working with SSG and praised the company’s content and data for being “the best in the industry.” Hale further lauded his company’s new partner for its expertise, saying that the deal is sure to benefit XL Media.</p>
<p>We believe this horseracing expertise will add immense value to our audience as we launch over the busy Cheltenham Festival. The innovative Superfeed content engine will allow us to best serve our customers at scale due to the flexibility that the single API integration offers. Darren Hale, director of commercial partnerships, XL Media</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Spotlight Sports Group’s head of UK and Ireland B2B sales, Daniel Smith, said that he is just as thrilled to be working with XL Media. He added that his team is honored that such an affiliate powerhouse has chosen to trust SSG’s Superfeed content engine.</p>
<p>We know that our racing content provides prospective bettors with important insight and we are excited to help improve user engagement and grow an already loyal customer base. Daniel Smith, head of UK and Ireland B2B sales, SSG</p>
<p>Speaking of Superfeed, at the beginning of 2023, the company introduced a major upgrade to its content engine. This resulted in the delivery of richer content from more markets and across more sports events and leagues.</p>
