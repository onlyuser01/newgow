    <h1>Ricky Gap Casino Salary Of Casino Dealer Free Casino Bus Trips Near Me Best Odds At Casino Southern</h1>

<p>Reflex Gaming and Yggdrasil have joined forces to mix up one of their most magical slot games yet. Purrfect Potions, the providers’ new 5×3 title, allows players to join a potion-brewing cat and prepare magical elixirs for great prizes.</p>
<p>Purrfect Potions Metrics</p>
<p>Reels: 5</p>
<p>Rows: 3</p>
<p>Paylines: 20</p>
<p>RTP: 95.5%</p>
<p>Volatility: High</p>
<p>Min/Max stake: 0.2-100</p>
<p>Max win: 22,108x</p>
<p>Brew the Strongest Potions with Professor Purrfect</p>
<p>When playing Purrfect Potions, players will join the magical feline Professor Purrfect, helping it prepare the strongest magical beverages. To that end, players will collect a variety of symbols, ranging from letters to potions, moon symbols and magical hats.</p>
<p>When players land on a Purrfect Potions symbol, they will immediately trigger one of three Wild Boost bonuses – Wild Magic, Magic Touch and Mystery Wilds. The first of the three will create one to four stacked wild symbols. Magic Touch, on the other hand, spawns between two and eight wild symbols at random locations. Finally, Mystery Wilds creates between two and eight multiplier wilds that can be worth as much as 50x.</p>
<p>Should players land on three scatter symbols depicting Professor Purrfect, they will automatically get up to 16 free spins, triggering free spins mode. During free spins, players can land on additional trio scatter symbols, gaining additional spins and extending their time in this mode.</p>
<p>During free spins mode, wild boost will grant special respins that will not cost free spins and will keep the wild symbols locked in place, allowing players to score some amazing combinations.</p>
<p>If players are taking a while to trigger free spins mode or simply wish to speed things up, they can use the special Magic Bet feature. The mechanic increases players’ stake by 50% but more than doubles their chance to activate free spins.</p>
<p>Alternatively, players can buy free spins (in markets where this is allowed), triggering the mode whenever they want.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil and Reflex Gaming Are Content with How the Game Turned Out</p>
<p>Stuart McCarthy, Yggdrasil’s head of product and programs, commented on the new release, saying that Purrfect Potions “hits the mark” of being a magical and entertaining iGaming product.</p>
<p>We’re excited to see players get acquainted with Professor Purrfect and get stuck into this enchanting new game. Stuart McCarthy, head of product and programs, Yggdrasil</p>
<p>Mat Ingram, Reflex Gaming’s chief product officer, also commented on the matter. He said that his team delights in creating imaginative games and noted that his company really enjoyed working on Purrfect Potions.</p>
<p>We feel that this game is a charming and amicable addition to our growing portfolio. Mat Ingram, CPO, Reflex Gaming</p>
<p>Ingram added that Purrfect Potions is the purrfect game for players that desire light-hearted and fun experiences.</p>
