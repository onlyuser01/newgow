    <h1>Cleopatra Jones And The Casino Of Gold Atlantis Hotel Casino Blaze Casino Scam Casino Clearwater Tra</h1>

<p>Jacktime, a provider of advanced software solutions to the sports betting industry, has agreed to supply the SKS365-owned Planetwin365 brand with its products. As a result, the Italian operator will be able to use Jacktime’s BETCORE solution to engage its customers.</p>
<p>BETCORE Adds a Layer of Gamification to Sports Betting</p>
<p>BETCORE is a solution that makes it easier for players to place bets as it allows them to withdraw their stakes before a game has ended. At that point in time, customers may be awarded money depending on the market odds of their bet.</p>
<p>As agreed with Jacktime, the new feature will be rolled out for all of the big sporting events. SKS365 announced that it will be available both online and in Planetwin 365 shops. The operator also noted that BETCORE will be available for soccer, basketball and tennis events.</p>
<p>By using BETCORE customers can cash out their single and multiple bets. Depending on how lucky or unlucky they feel, players can cash out their bets either during the match or pre-match. SKS365 promised that it will eventually add the feature to more sporting events and bet types.</p>
<p>The Companies Are Sure Customers Are Going to Love the New Feature</p>
<p>Jim Parkins, SKS365’s chief product and technology officer, spoke on the agreement with Jacktime. He said that the launch of a cash out mechanic is a true game-changer that will bring Planetwin365 “into a new era of sports betting.” Parkins added that this deal represents a huge milestone for the company’s strategy to offer customers increasingly gamified experiences.</p>
<p>The officer also noted that his team is very proud to be one of the first companies in Italy to sport such a feature. He is sure that the flexibility BETCORE offers will be invaluable to fans.</p>
<p>We are confident that the cash out will be very much valued by our customers, since it will allow them to manage the whole betting experience, from choosing the events to bet on, to the winnings collection. Jim Parkins, CPTO, SKS365</p>
<p>Jacktime’s chief executive officer, Maximilian Kock, also commented on the agreement. He congratulated both companies’ teams on the integration of the BETCORE engine and said that he is excited to see SKS365 adopt the solution.</p>
<p>We are excited and proud that SKS365 has chosen to integrate the Jacktime BETCORE engine into its platform as part of this important journey to allow them to have a best-in-class cash out solution on product, technological and trading level. Maximilian Kock, CEO, Jacktime</p>
<p>In November, Planetwin365 further bolstered its portfolio thanks to a separate content-oriented agreement with ESA Gaming. Two weeks ago, SKS365 was named one of Italy’s top employers.</p>
