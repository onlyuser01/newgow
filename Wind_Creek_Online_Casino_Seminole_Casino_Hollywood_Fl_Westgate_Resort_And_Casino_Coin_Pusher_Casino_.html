<p>Yggdrasil has announced a new partnership with casino operator LVC Diamond in Hungary which will see both companies strengthen their local footprints, and the supplier considerably expand its reach in the regulated iGaming landscape in the country.</p>
<p>As Hungary is an increasingly important market for suppliers, not least owing to Spinomenal’s recent entry into the market with the exact same company, Yggdrasil too is determined to grow its footprint in a sustainable and determined way.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil has picked LVC Diamond, the operator of the Vegas.hu brand, to introduce its YG Masters titles, and ensure that it continues to grow in the regulated European market. Yggdrasil has plenty to offer to audiences with Vegas.hu players now enjoying all of the brand’s Game Engagement Mechanic titles to date.</p>
<p>The games that will be available include Excalibur VS GigaBlox, Sidewinder DoubleMax, and many others. In welcoming the opportunity, LVC Diamond Head of Casino and Studio Brigitta Szenczy noted that Yggdrasil is indeed a supplier that has known how to appeal to players and build robust connections with audiences ever since it first arrived in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>"We want to be the standout brand in Hungary, and offering world-leading content is a strong recipe for success," Szenczy explained, adding that the collaboration with Yggdrasil is definitely going to be a contributing factor to this end.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil Commercial Director Jose Kadala was similarly happy. The executive welcomed the opportunity to work with LVC Diamond and see the supplier’s portfolio integrated with the company’s flagship brand which is quickly gaining momentum around the Hungarian iGaming market.</p>
<p>He assured that Yggdrasil is only bringing the best and most worthwhile games to its partners, and the opportunity to work with the operator will strengthen its presence in the country further.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil has grown its footprint at a good clip over the past several weeks, with the company growing in the Netherlands with Circus.nl at the end of December and the company further expanding its presence in Switzerland with Swiss4Win.ch.</p>
<p>As Hungary becomes an even more attractive market locally, the company is determined to grow there as well.</p>
