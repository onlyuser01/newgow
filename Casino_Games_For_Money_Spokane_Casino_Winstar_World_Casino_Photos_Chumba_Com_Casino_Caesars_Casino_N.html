    <h1>Casino Games For Money Spokane Casino Winstar World Casino Photos Chumba Com Casino Caesars Casino N</h1>

<p>Hello dear Casino - Guru Team,</p>
<p>So far I have unfortunately had a very negative impression of the VulkanVegas Casino.</p>
<p>It starts like this:</p>
<p>€ 20 deposited</p>
<p>(KYC, Known your customer) Check passed! You will also receive the confirmation by email. (They really wanted a lot of documents, including a selfie with a personal ID, I'm not used to that from other casinos, Trustly and everything is verified, mostly.)</p>
<p>€ 126 successfully paid out (was transferred to my account)</p>
<p>I thought to myself, the casino is really nice, let's put a few bullets in there.</p>
<p>€ 50 deposited lost</p>
<p>€ 50 deposited lost</p>
<p>€ 100 deposited lost</p>
<p>€ 200 deposited lost</p>
<p>€ 250 deposited (last bullet for that day)</p>
<p>Played up to € 2230 and requested to be paid out.</p>
<p>The next day</p>
<p>If my payment was canceled with a standard mail, I should verify my account with the KYC test.</p>
<p>Uploaded a total of 10 documents (since I passed the KYC TEST for the first time) including money in and out of my account, including transfers to the casino itself.</p>
<p>Incidentally, € 63.13 was successfully paid out of my first € 20 deposit (was transferred to my account.)</p>
<p>I absolutely do not understand where the problem is here, especially since I have enough money and of course only play with money that I can wipe off my nose if I lose it.</p>
<p>Long back and forth in the chat determined 10 "different" support agents</p>
<p>Current status according to chat: Source of Wealth check is under review. Can take "days". Payout of 2230 € usually also 5 days.</p>
<p>I'm not very convinced of this casino, even with my last deposit of € 250 I had to make ~ € 500 bets after I had increased to € 2100,</p>
<p>otherwise the casino will deduct a 20% commission from the balance. Fortunately, despite 100 x € 4.50 spins stakes, I got stuck at € 2230.</p>
<p>Got two very high multiplier bonuses in Dead or Alive 2 and both paid almost nothing. (A rogue who thinks bad).</p>
<p>It seems to me as if extra, arbitrary stones are placed in the way so that I should trip over them and continue to gamble so that I lose the money. Chicane in the payout now seems to be added.</p>
<p>For me an absolutely negative experience and incomprehensible why this casino has such a positive rating. I've tested a lot of casinos, but this one</p>
<p>Clauses with the terms and conditions seem to outperform all of them in negative respects.</p>
<p>I know relatively little time has passed</p>
<p>I have no other choice now than to wait, I will continue to report. I hope that this check will be completed as soon as possible and that I will receive my money and profit.</p>
<p>The bottom line of this casino</p>
<p>will of course get worse the longer the payout takes and the more stones they want to put in my way.</p>
<p>greetings</p>
