    <h1>Sunset Station Casino Henderson Nevada Casino Game Online Free Angel In The Winds Casino Casinos In</h1>

<p>Things are well in the Bay State with the Massachusetts Gaming Commission now officially planning a soft sports betting launch on January 30, followed by a full launch on the next day should plans remain unchanged. This means that the state could have in-person sports betting just in time for Super Bowl LVII. The news was revealed as part of the commissionâ€™s Public Meeting last week.</p>
<p>The launch date will still give a fair leeway to residents to put down their wagers at any of the three casinos that have been approved to offer sports gambling products in the state, in different capacities, including MGM Springfield, Plainridge Park Casino, and not least, Encore Boston Harbor.</p>
<p>There are still a few wrinkles to iron out, nevertheless. For one, the company that is tasked with verifying the fairness of the kiosks and betting terminals at each location would have to complete the necessary checks ahead of schedule. Gaming Labs International is hopeful that it can get it all done within the specified time window by January 27.</p>
<p>MGM Springfield and Encore BastonHarbor have obtained a full betting license, costing them $5m each, and Plainridge Park Casino have so far been found suitable to hold a license under a temporary mandate, although it seems like the property will be able to obtain full licensure without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Commissioners will also be present at the soft launch with one representative at each of the casinos drawn at random. The kiosk software testing is set to take place on January 16, with January 27 coinciding with the awarding of licenses across retail locations. Apart from in-person betting, each casino has teamed up with an online sportsbook to offer interactive gambling options to sports bettors.</p>
<p>As of the time of writing, MGM Springfield is the only property to have also received a conditional license to go ahead with a mobile betting launch. Its partner, BetMGM, has the green light. Others are still awaiting approvals, but some controversy has already emerged in the Bay State.</p>
<p>For one, Barstool is facing responsible gambling and probity concerns by the commission. Meanwhile, the actual launch date of mobile betting still remains undetermined by the regulator with a tight window ahead for all stakeholders. Nevertheless, all signs point to the fact that Massachusetts will have sports gambling up and running on time for the Big Game.</p>
