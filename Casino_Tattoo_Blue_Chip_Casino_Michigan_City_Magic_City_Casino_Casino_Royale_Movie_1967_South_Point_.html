    <h1>Casino Tattoo Blue Chip Casino Michigan City Magic City Casino Casino Royale Movie 1967 South Point</h1>

<p>Pete Rose’s life has almost come full circle. He holds a number of MLB records and should have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame years ago. However, a black cloud in the form of sports betting hangs over his head to this day, despite the US now embracing the activity. Statements are now being made, though, that could turn back the clocks and allow Rose to finally receive the attention he deserves. Not only has he launched his own sports betting podcast, but he will also be placing the first bet to inaugurate the grand opening of the Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati in Ohio.</p>
<p>Pete Rose’s Betting Podcast on Quake</p>
<p>Rose holds the MLB record for the most hits, which has stood at 4,256 since 1986, when he ended his playing career with the Cincinnati Reds. The slugger, now 80 years old, also has three World Series titles with the Reds, three National League batting titles and is a 17-time All-Star. He is also the former manager of the Reds, a position he held while playing with the team and which carried over after he hung up his cleats.</p>
<p>None of that matters to some of MLB’s brass, though, as the achievements are overshadowed by Rose’s former penchant for sports betting. He was banned from MLB in 1989 for betting on sports (although he asserts he never bet on baseball), and the ban also prevents him from being considered for the Baseball Hall of Fame. Multiple attempts through four MLB commissioners to have the ban reversed have all failed.</p>
<p>The baseball world never stopped supporting Rose and he is now coming back into the limelight through Pete Rose’s Daily Picks, a new podcast that saw its inauguration yesterday on Quake Media. There will be six episodes a week, with Rose offering his picks on a variety of sports – including baseball. It’s the first sports-related podcast to appear on Quake, the premium podcast service.</p>
<p>Rose said prior to yesterday’s first show, “This is going to be a fun chance for me to talk about the sports I love. I’ll share how I think about games with Ben and the fans, then we can watch and learn together. There are some insights, I believe, that only an old guy like me may think of. I’m excited to share my winning predictions with my fans.”</p>
<p>Rose to Inaugurate New Cincinnati Casino</p>
<p>Later this month, on October 29, the newly-rebranded Hard Rock Casino in Cincinnati, OH, will celebrate its grand opening. Hard Rock purchased the former Jack Casino brand two years ago and has begun to introduce its standard fixtures since then, and the upcoming celebration marks the completion of all of those efforts.</p>
<p>To welcome the completion and to usher in a new era of gaming in Cincinnati, Hard Rock has invited Rose to place the first bet. The property, which features 1,628 slot machines, 84 table games and 33,000 square feet of dining and meeting space, will make an inaugural table bet that not only signals the beginning of a Hard Rock era in Cincinnati but, perhaps, also the beginning of a new era of success for Rose. It could also be a signal that MLB will finally make amends with the baseball icon.</p>
