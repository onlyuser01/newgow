    <h1>Two Kings Casino Casino Cruise Casinos In Atlantic City Nj 888 Casino Casinos In Santa Fe MiFinity t</h1>

<p>PressEnter Group, a bold mobile-first iGaming company, has inked a new deal with MiFinity, an eWallet company that allows customers to pay online. As per the agreement, MiFinity will allow PressEnter’s customers to pay online using its solutions.</p>
<p>MiFinity to Provide PressEnter with Payment Solutions</p>
<p>The new deal will provide PressEnter’s customers with greater flexibility when playing and playing online. This will allow customers to focus on gaming without having to distract themselves with complicated deposit procedures.</p>
<p>MiFinity’s eWallet provides over 40 payment methods that will allow users of PressEnter’s various brands to enjoy seamless online gambling experiences. The latter company operates brands such as NitroCasino, NeonVegas, RapidCasino, UltraCasino, JustSpin and 21.com. Therefore, the deal with MiFinity will improve the customer experience of thousands of players.</p>
<p>In addition, MiFinity will help out PressEnter by sharing its experience with processing payouts in some of the more complicated jurisdictions. The eWallet supports 17 currencies and allows for both local bank settlements and international settlements.</p>
<p>PressEnter Users to Get a Free Virtual IBAN</p>
<p>Carl Degiorgio, PressEnter Group’s chief operating officer, noted that PressEnter Group remains dedicated to delivering best-in-class iGaming experiences. Because of this, the company is always looking to make things more convenient for the players. To that end, improving the payment methods is one of the best ways to cater to customers’ needs.</p>
<p>We partnered with MiFinity because they offer a wide selection of localized payment options and are continuously innovating and improving the payment flow and journey. Hence, it is quick, intuitive and secure for our customers. Carl Degiorgio, COO, PressEnter Group</p>
<p>MiFinity’s chief executive officer, Paul Kavanagh, also commented on the deal. He noted that his team is delighted to join PressEnter Group and help it expand its European footprint. Kavanagh is sure that MiFinity’s payment options will make PressEnter’s offerings more appealing to fans and will help the company differentiate itself from its competitors.</p>
<p>The partnership with MiFinity will also allow customers of PressEnter’s online customers to link a free virtual IBAN to their eWallets. Kavanagh explained that a virtual IBAN will provide customers with further flexibility when paying online.</p>
<p>With a virtual IBAN, we’ve gone a step further and made free transfers available to all EEA and UK users. Virtual IBANs are great for PressEnter Group’s customers with no fees to pay; they have more to spend, which also benefits our merchants. Paul Kavanagh, CEO, MiFinity</p>
<p>A month ago, PressEnter also inked a deal with Neccton, a provider of responsible gaming tools. This provided users of PressEnter’s online brands with a higher degree of protection, shielding them from gambling harm.</p>
