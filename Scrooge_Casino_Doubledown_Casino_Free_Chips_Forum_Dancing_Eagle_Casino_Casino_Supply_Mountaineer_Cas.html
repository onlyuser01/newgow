<p>Playtika has purchased JustPlay.LoL, a platform that has developed the battle royale game 1v1.LOL. The title is a third-person shooter game that is predicated on experiences similar to Garena Free Fire, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, and Fortnite.</p>
<p>1v1.LOL Makes Fine Addition to Playtika’s Portfolio</p>
<p>Playtika has completed the acquisition in a bid to continue adding to what it claims is a constantly expanding portfolio of opportunities for new games. No financial details about the deal have been disclosed at this point. Commenting on this, company chief strategy officer Eric Rapps said:</p>
<p>“The acquisition of JustPlay.LOL and its leading title, 1v1.LOL, continues our strategy of diversifying the game genres we operate in as we leverage our industry-leading game operations technology to grow revenue via our Boost Platform.” Playtika company chief strategy officer Eric Rapps</p>
<p>JustPlay.LOL was founded back in 2018 by Lior and Boris Alterman who presided over the company’s heady growth and the successful launch of the 1v1.LOL title. With over 700,000 daily active users and more than 50 million downloads, 1v1.LOL is one of the most prominent titles in the battle royale genre and has been able to grow its footprint with gaming audiences despite heavy competition in the vertical.</p>
<p>Rapps praised the progress achieved by JustPlay.LOL in engaging and developing strong bonds with audiences. He also added that Playtika would continue to work with JustPlay.LOL and its team in order to expand the entertainment experience as much as possible.</p>
<p>Playtika continues to develop its portfolio of games that focus on social and more mainstream gaming experiences as the iGaming experience continues to evolve away from traditional casino gaming and focuses on skill-based gaming and even esports. Atlantic City recently hosted an esports tournament for NFL Madden 22.</p>
