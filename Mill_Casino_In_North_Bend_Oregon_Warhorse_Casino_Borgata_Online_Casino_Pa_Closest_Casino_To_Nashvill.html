<p>A freshly inked partnership between the duo will see Stats Perform power the PlayStyles+ and PlayStyles features for the upcoming FC24 game</p>
<p>The leading sports data and analytics company, Stats Perform, announced a new important partnership with Electronic Arts (EA). Details regarding the new collaboration emerged Monday and see Stats Perform power EA’s PlayStyles features for its upcoming EA SPORTS FC 24 game. Announced ahead of the launch of the game, which is expected to be a real blockbuster, the collaboration sees Stats Perform elevate the realism and authenticity of the gameplay.</p>
<p>This will be achieved by leveraging Opta data, which includes performance data collected in real-time from more than 200 women’s and men’s soccer competitions across the globe. Powering FC24’s PlayStyles and PlayStyles+ features, the players will benefit from engaging gameplay based on real-life strengths and traits the players have. Moreover, the players of the upcoming game will benefit from signature skills.</p>
<p>The launch campaign of Player Ratings and PlayStyles received a boost from Opta data that brought statistics and data from soccer competitions. Upon the release of FC24, more than 30 PlayStyles are expected to be incorporated. Such would include passing, duels, dribbling, crossing, set pieces, across shooting, blocking and interceptions among many others. Ultimately, the wide and detailed Opta data will be the core of the PlayStyles+ and PlayStyles features.</p>
<p>The partnership with EA comes after earlier this year, Stats Perform extended its collaboration with Football DataCo. That agreement saw the company remain the official statistics partner of the EFL, EPL and SPFL. This enabled Stats Perform to continue to distribute Scottish and English soccer data covering thousands of games.</p>
<p>EA Is Excited to Team Up with Stats Perform</p>
<p>Carl Mergele, Stats Perform’s CEO, revealed that soccer fans enjoy the sport in different ways. He added that it is great to see the benefits Opta data brings. “We are delighted that our ongoing investment in collecting, generating and distributing the fastest, most accurate detailed data has been trusted by EA to play a role in such an exciting new experience,” explained Mergele. Finally, the CEO said that the company hopes its Opta data will elevate the thrill and excitement for FC24 players.</p>
<p>“This is an exciting new direction for us. For FC24 we’re seeing the very first introduction of Opta into the game, helping us to validate and optimize our existing processes but going into future years, we’ll see the partnership expand to new heights.“ Michael Mueller-Moehring, head of data collection and licensing at EA Sports</p>
<p>Michael Mueller-Moehring, EA Sports’ head of data collection and licensing, revealed that the partnership marks an exciting moment for the company. He confirmed that the implementation of Opta data into FC24 will optimize strategic processes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mueller-Moehring said that EA anticipates expanding its collaboration with Stats Perform. He acknowledged that Opta data is leveraged by clubs, leagues and broadcasters across the globe. Mueller-Moehring praised the data that provides vital details and predicted that it will elevate the realism and engagement for EA’s upcoming game.</p>
