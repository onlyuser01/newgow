<p>Livespins continues to build upon its impressive portfolio of suppliers and content providers for the company’s unique way of introducing new content to casino fans.</p>
<p>Livespins Launches with Silver Bullet Platform by Relax</p>
<p>Livespins, which focuses on live streaming casino slots to large audiences on Twitch has struck a new partnership with Relax Gaming, which will give the company and its streamers access to more than 70 studios integrated as part of the Silver Bullet platform run by Relax.</p>
<p>This partnership is huge for Relax Gaming, its partners, and Livespins, which will all benefit from having access to the world’s best slot games. Those games include Temple Tumble, Banana Town, and Money Train 2, to name just a few all-time fan-favorite games that are rapidly establishing their presence in the iGaming sector.</p>
<p>The added love they are now going to be shown by Livespins’ streamers will certainly not hurt. Livespins focuses on an innovative blend of experiences where players can bet alongside their favorite streamers by splitting the stakes and risk with fellow viewers. Livespins has built a powerful gamification and engagement tool that has been enjoying huge results and has been one of the true innovators of the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>Livespins CCO Michael Pederson welcomed this opportunity and said that Relax Gaming is one of the most significant companies when it comes to aggregating iGaming content, and slots in particular. He elaborated on why great content mattered and added:</p>
<p>Quality content is a key component to any successful stream and by combining slots from Relax Gaming and its studio partners with our innovative platform and superstar streamers, we have the factors in place to provide an entertaining and thrilling player experience. Livespins CCO Michael Pederson</p>
<p>Both Relax and Livespins Happy with The Partnership</p>
<p>Pedersen confirmed that Livespins is on the market to ensure that players are provided with the best possible experience and one way to make this happen is by partnering up with the right suppliers and content facilitators such as Relax Gaming.</p>
<p>Relax Gaming CCO Nadiya Attard was equally pleased to have the opportunity to team up with Livespins. She said that streaming is becoming one of the most significant channels for players to enjoy the online casino experience, and Livespins leads the way in this innovative segment to begin with.</p>
<p>Thanks to Silver Bullet, players will now have the opportunity to access more games and opportunities.</p>
