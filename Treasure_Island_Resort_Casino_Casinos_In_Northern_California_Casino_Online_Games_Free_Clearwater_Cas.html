<p>Sportradar Group, a company at the intersection between sports, media and betting, announced that it has expanded its US presence with a new license. As reported by the company, it successfully secured a temporary sports betting supplier license for the state of Maine.</p>
<p>According to the official announcement, the license was handed to Sportradar’s US betting subsidiary, Sportradar Solutions, by the Maine Gambling Control Unit (MGCU) on November 1. This allows the company to make a foray into the Pine Tree State, solidifying its US footprint.</p>
<p>As a result, Sportradar now holds a total of 53 licenses across North America. The company’s products are thus available across US states, territories and tribes, as well as in Canada. Companies in these jurisdictions can employ Sportradar’s cutting-edge products and services and benefit from the fast, accurate and reliable data it offers.</p>
<p>Sportradar remains committed to not only supporting sports betting and gaming companies but also advancing transparency and integrity across the sector.</p>
<p>In other news, Sportradar recently posted strong Q3 results and highlighted the achievements of its business during the quarter ended September 30. The company recorded a noticeable uptick in revenue and reaffirmed its strength in cross-selling and upselling to its clients.</p>
<p>Sportradar also confirmed its plans to streamline its operating structure and reduce its global workforce. As a result, Sportradar is set to part ways with a number of workers, leading to an approximate 10% reduction in 2023 labor cost run rates.</p>
<p>Sportradar is also set to benefit from the launch of betting in Florida, although the legal battle between the Seminole Tribe and West Flagler continues.</p>
<p>DraftKings Was among the First to Enter Maine’s Fresh Market</p>
<p>Maine is one of the latest states to launch sports betting following the repeal of the PASPA in 2018. It joined several dozen states where wagering on sports is already legal, bringing the total number of states with live regulated betting markets to 37. In addition to that, betting is also live and legal in the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>Maine legalized both retail and online betting, allowing gambling companies to tap into new audiences. DraftKings, one of America’s biggest sports betting operators, was among the first to set foot in Maine. Launching in the Pine Tree State in partnership with the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the operator was welcomed by tribe officials who praised the opportunity to work with an industry leader.</p>
<p>DraftKings’ wagering products resonated with players in the state, as demonstrated by the stellar opening weekend.</p>
