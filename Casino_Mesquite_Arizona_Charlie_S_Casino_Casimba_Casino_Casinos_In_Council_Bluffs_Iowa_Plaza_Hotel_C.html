<p>Dear Smitvallary1988,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m sorry to hear about your problem. Please allow me to ask you a few questions, so I can understand the whole situation completely. I have checked the general terms and conditions, and this is what I found (here):</p>
<p>"Rewards</p>
<p>In order to receive points and/or purchase an item with the points via the store, a Player must make at least one (1) deposit. points and items are subject to limitations as set in the applicable terms and conditions. Any use and/or redemption contrary to those terms and conditions is null and void.</p>
<p>Items purchased via the store will expire after 30 days from the date of the purchase.</p>
<p>All items purchased via the store must be wagered a minimum of 50 (fifty) times in 30 days; failure to do so shall result in the expiry of the points and/or in revocation of all winnings generated from such bonuses.</p>
<p>Winnings generated from free spin bonus purchased via the store are limited to R400</p>
<p>Winnings generated from items purchased via the store are limited to the lower of (i) 3 (three) times the items amount (and in the case of free spins – the bonus amount equals the winnings received from the free spin), or (ii) the total amount of deposits made by the Player until the date in which the bonus was received as a prize or redeemed at the store.</p>
<p>All items purchased via the store are subject to all other items terms and conditions."</p>
<p>Could you please advise if any of the slot machines are available to play with real money funds? Have you had any game sessions prior to trying free play with your redeemed comp points? If there's any relevant communication, please forward it to petronela.k@casino.guru.</p>
<p>I hope we will be able to help you to resolve your problem as soon as possible. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Petronela</p>
