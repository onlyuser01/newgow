<p>The UK Gaming Commission has granted Jogo Global a remote gambling software and games host casino license. The regulatory approval allows the company to partner and extend its product line up to UK-licensed operators.</p>
<p>Jogo Global offers several main types of products – from gaming platforms to premium mobile, online, and land-based content, as well as customized software development and gamification platforms. This is another step forward for the company, and according to their press release, they are looking forward to finalizing several commercial agreements over the coming months, giving the company a foothold in the market.</p>
<p>The Winds of Change at Jogo Global</p>
<p>The UKGC license comes on the tail of another partnership. Last week, a partnership with SCCG Management was announced. The consultancy firm will help Jogo Global to increase the pace of its expansion. In July, Jogo Global appointed Gaming Realms co-founder Simon Collins, was appointed as non-executive chairman and added Robb Vecchio as managing director of the US division, who will oversee the expansion in the United States.</p>
<p>Jogo Global operates from four main locations – Minneapolis, US, London, UK, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Florianopolis, Brazil. In October, the company also appeared for the first time at G2G – the Global Gaming Expo in the US with the hopes of establishing new partnerships in the North American market.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Vecchio confirmed that growth in the US market is a priority, while the company remains focused on its core services, “a content developer and a platform provider working across both online and retail.” He also confirmed the news that within the next few months, Jogo Global is about to announce other new partnerships.</p>
<p>The US and the UK Gaming Market</p>
<p>Times couldn’t have been better for companies seeking expansion in the US and the UK, such as Jogo Global. The US gambling market is set to tackle a new record, with projections putting its value at $44 billion in 2021. This breathtaking growth is largely owing to new regulations allowing online gambling to be available in states, which until recently had no active legislation about betting.</p>
<p>In the UK, the gambling market saw a decrease of about $115 million from 2018 to 2020, but this was due to a transition to online platforms and online betting and gambling. Currently, such platforms enjoy great success, and remote betting is seeing steady growth on quarterly terms.</p>
