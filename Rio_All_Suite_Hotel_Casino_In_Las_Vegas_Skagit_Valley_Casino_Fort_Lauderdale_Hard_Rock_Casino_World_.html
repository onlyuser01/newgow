    <h1>Rio All Suite Hotel Casino In Las Vegas Skagit Valley Casino Fort Lauderdale Hard Rock Casino World</h1>

<p>Dear CasinoGuru team,</p>
<p>on August 2nd I signed up, on August 11th I made a deposit of 99.98 euros via Bitcoin. After a bit of play I requested a withdrawal of 100.04 euros on August 30th - of course all wagering requirements were met and verified beforehand (see emails).</p>
<p>According to support, payouts take "between 1 and 9 working days". When nothing arrived after 15 days, I asked support and they said there were currently delays. After 30 days, a message came from the system that the withdrawal request was automatically canceled due to the duration. I have also attached this for you. Sorry the website screenshots are in German, I didn't find an option to change the language there.</p>
<p>When I asked support, they promised to clarify where the problem was and get back to me, asking me to request the payment again. Since then, all inquiries have not been answered, I have never heard anything. Of course, a new withdrawal request is also not processed.</p>
<p>I am sending you the (short) email correspondence with the casino as an attachment. Furthermore, the two withdrawal requests plus the system email with the rejection.</p>
<p>The casino has not responded to my last e-mails, since the message (see attachment) that you will get back to me there has never been a response.</p>
<p>Many thanks for your great help in advance!</p>
