    <h1>Casinos In Blackhawk Colorado Casino Orlando Casino Gaming Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel Casino Las Vegas</h1>

<p>Good afternoon ! I would like to make a complaint and ask if possible for another help from the guru. I made a deposit on the N1 Bet Casino website and received a bonus of 100 percent in the value of the deposit I made and the amount was 200 reais so on the website to get the bonus rollover I would have to make 10 thousand reais, I played all night to get the bonus rollover I had a balance worth 3000 thousand reais when I went to check the progression of my bonus when I saw only 300 reais missing so I went looking for another slot to easily finish the bonus rollover which I ended up with the slot book of rebirth in what I got the rollover so I made a withdrawal in the amount of 3300 reais, about 4 hours passed, I received an email that my withdrawal was canceled and that my balance would be confiscated because they explained that I bet a greater amount and the site would not accept having placed these bets in that amount greater than 30 reais . So I entered the chat and wanted to know where I had placed that bet because I played all night and I had not bet more than 10 reais. I even made this bet because my bonus was already 99% complete, so being crazy to increase the bet that way I verified that the problem would be in the slot, it was not my fault because when I entered to play in the book casino I thought I was betting 4.50 reais, but for what I they passed I was betting 45 reais I didn't know because I left it on automatic and I had seen that the bet would be 4.50 I passed everything explained to the site and their attendants but they don't even want to know they just said that it was canceled and confiscated so in case they have these rules and for their profit and catch people who don't know about this rule I knew more about the slot book of rebirth made me deceive, they don't care if you bet or not if it was in good faith or they don't just want the amount the person wins, I'll send the print of the slot and the bet that I stopped in the game because it is clueless for them to think that I played on purpose because my bonus was already complete I played the whole night in several slots and I didn't spend the bet amount of 10 reais just by mistake even though this problem happened and it wasn't a mistake the slot made me cheat because I'm going to pass the print you can verify that anyone would think that the bet was 4.50 that's what I thought in this case. So I ask the help of the guru here because I think it is very unfair to confiscate my balance and another I did not even use the bonus balance, but the site has a rule about bonuses, but this rule of the bigger bet was only made because the game deceived me, I did not have fault so please I ask again for some help here from you. Thank you and I await your reply. I will send here the print of the slot that I was tricked into thinking I was making a smaller bet. ps I'm trying to send the print of the game and the email I received and replied from the site but it's just showing an error so I can send it to your email later.</p>
