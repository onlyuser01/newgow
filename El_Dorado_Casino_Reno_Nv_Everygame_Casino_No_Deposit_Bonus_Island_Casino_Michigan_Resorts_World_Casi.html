<p>The recent launch marks the first time leading games from Play’n GO are available for customers in the Wolverine State.

<p>Focusing on the future, Olsson predicted that more states will introduce regulated online gaming activities in the next one or two years.

<p>“Launching today in Michigan with BetMGM is another fantastic step forward in our partnership,“ added Olsson</p>
<p>Olsson added that players in Michigan, as well as New Jersey, have reaffirmed the need for an iGaming market by demanding safe and responsible online gambling entertainment.
