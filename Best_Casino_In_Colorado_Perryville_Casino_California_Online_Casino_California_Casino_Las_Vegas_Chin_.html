<p>The Lotería de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires cleared Yggdrasil for launch in the region, allowing it to further consolidate its LATAM presence</p>
<p>Yggdrasil, one of the best publishers of gaming titles, continues its global expansion with a new development in Latin America. The company announced that it just received regulatory approval to launch its games in the City of Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil Enters the City of Buenos Aires</p>
<p>As reported by the company, it received approval from the Lotería de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, which allows it to enter the region. Now that Yggdrasil has been greenlit to make a foray into the city, local companies will be able to adopt some of its critically-acclaimed titles.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s content has proven to be highly engaging time and time again and is highly sought-after by operators. The company is still pumping out innovative and engaging games on a regular basis. Some of the recently-published releases include Double Lucky Mushrooms by Reflex Gaming, Festival 10K Ways by ReelPlay and Dragon Blox Gigablox by Peter &amp; Sons.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil announced that many of its games will be launched in the local market, which will notably include games featuring the company’s proprietary Game Engagement Mechanic. Other notable releases that fans in Buenos Aires can expect are slot games from the YG Masters program.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil Continues Growing Its Business</p>
<p>The launch in Buenos Aires further consolidates Yggdrasil’s presence in Latin America. It follows the publisher’s launch in Colombia, which was the company’s previous regional expansion. Buenos Aires launched its online gambling market in early 2021, allowing operators and suppliers to offer their products in the region. While not the first supplier to hit the market, Yggdrasil will very much be among the ones with the largest content portfolios in the Argentine capital.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil’s chief executive officer, Björn Krantz, release a statement on the new Argentine license, saying that he is very excited to launch the company’s products in Buenos Aires. He also added that this launch is an important milestone for the publisher.</p>
<p>We are starting the year with a great milestone in achieving the approval to supply our content in the City of Buenos Aires. Björn Krantz, CEO, Yggdrasil</p>
<p>2023 will be an important year for Yggdrasil, which will celebrate its 10th birthday. The publisher announced that it will use the opportunity to focus on further expansion of its portfolio and market reach.</p>
<p>2022 was a very busy year for Yggdrasil. In December, the company expanded into Germany’s gaming market, thanks to an agreement with Jokerstar. A few days prior to that, Yggdrasil joined forces with Reflex Gaming to launch new game mechanics in the UK retail market.</p>
