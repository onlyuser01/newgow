<p>Siltanen is set to strengthen the leadership team before ECA Chair Per Jaldung steps down from the role in February</p>
<p>The representative body of national casino associations and individual operators of licensed land-based casinos in Europe, the European Casino Association (ECA), announced today it has appointed Tiina Siltanen as Vice Chair of the association.</p>
<p>ECA Annual General Meeting</p>
<p>The appointment of Siltanen was approved at the ECA’s Board Meeting that was held in Finland on December 15, in conjunction with the first anniversary of the Veikkaus Casino Tampere, where directors gathered to discuss the association’s preparations for the ECA Annual General Assembly slated to take place during ICE London in February.</p>
<p>During the meeting, ECA Chairman Per Jaldung outlined the importance for the association to strengthen its leadership going forward and be able to face the various challenges in front of the casino sector such as illegal gambling and the promotion of the industry globally.</p>
<p>“I am therefore pleased that the Board has unanimously approved the appointment of Tiina Siltanen as the Association’s Vice Chair,” Jaldung said, announcing that he would be “stepping down as Chairman of the ECA at the next General Assembly,” and convinced that “this appointment ensures strong leadership and robust support” for his successor.</p>
<p>Siltanen, who is currently responsible for a team of 160 casino professionals at Veikkaus casinos in Finland serving as General Manager for both Casino Helsinki and the new Casino Tampere, joined the ECA Board in 2021.</p>
<p>She is part of the ECA’s leadership team, together with Jaldung and Senior Vice President Pascal Camia, who is the Chief Operating Officer of Monte-Carlo Société des Bains de Mer, while the team is being supported by additional seven board members and a Secretary General.</p>
<p>Aware of What Needs to Be Done</p>
<p>Commenting on her appointment, Siltanen expressed how proud she feels that the ECA trusted her with more responsibilities after being on the board for two years, and while she does not feel new to the role, there are still things that require special attention.</p>
<p>“Still, there are topics of special importance, particularly concerning the ECA’s international events, human resource issues focused upon diversity and inclusion, and the overall reputation of the licensed casino sector to which I would like to devote attention in my new role,” Siltanen outlined.</p>
<p>Siltanen is a well-known leader in the casino sector in Europe, with more than 20 years of industry experience gained at customer service and executive levels, as well as a strong background in table games.</p>
<p>An alumna of the Executive Development Program at the University of Nevada Las Vegas and a holder of a BBA in business studies, she is determined to portray the professionalism of casino industry employees in a positive light.</p>
