    <h1>Top Des Casinos Casino 1995 Cast Lake Charles La Casino Hotels Colusa Casino Resort Cass Lake Casino</h1>

<p>The freshly opened and rebranded Horseshoe Las Vegas will be hosting the 54th edition of the WSOP, together with Paris Las Vegas Hotel &amp; Casino</p>
<p>This year’s World Series of Poker (WSOP) is expected to build on the momentum of last year’s successful tournament when over 197,000 participants from over 100 countries took their best shot at the mouth-watering total prize pool of $347.9 million which broke all previous records.</p>
<p>This year’s WSOP will mark the 54th edition of the most successful poker event on the planet and it will be held at the freshly rebranded Horseshoe Las Vegas Casino and Paris Las Vegas Hotel &amp; Casino between May 30 and July 18.</p>
<p>As explained by WSOP’s executive director and senior vice president Ty Stewart, the momentum created by the series making its debut on The Strip in 2022 is expected to generate record-breaking WSOP and World Championship events at the Las Vegas Hotel &amp; Casino and the Horseshoe Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The latter officially opened its gates to the public on March 24 after a year of multimillion-dollar remodeling.</p>
<p>“This Is the Year to Go to Vegas”</p>
<p>Stewart also added that this would be the perfect year to “get to Vegas” if the Main Event has been on your bucket list for a while. In 2023, the $10,000 No-Limit Hold’em World Championship will be held between July 3 and July 17.</p>
<p>Besides the freshly added permanent hall of fame poker room built at Horseshoe Las Vegas, the much-anticipated event will also feature the biggest capacity in the history of the series. No less than 608 tables will be spread across the convention space’s 200,000 square feet for nonstop live action.</p>
<p>WSOP 2023 will also host the first-ever $300 price point tournament in the history of the series.</p>
<p>Other exciting events to be looking forward to are the 600 Main Event Seats Guaranteed from GGPoker, where the latter will be providing 500 guaranteed Main Event seats on GGPoker.com via global qualifiers along with an extra 100 seats on the ClubGG.net subscription site.</p>
<p>The 600 total seats will have a massive prize pool of $6,000,000, representing more than double of GGPoker’s official qualifiers in 2022. The online satellites will be initiated in March.</p>
<p>The Main Event Mania at Casinos Worldwide will introduce the pioneer Global Qualification Weekend held on May 20-May 21 at live poker rooms located on four different continents. Right before the start of the series in Las Vegas, poker rooms from all parts of the world will reunite to offer Guaranteed Seat satellite tournaments, sending players to the 2023 Main Event.</p>
<p>Every poker room will organize step tournaments with buy-ins capped at $140 and a culminating mega of $1,175 that will award a guaranteed seat along with all travel expenses to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The Horseshoe Casino Held the First WSOP Tournament in 1970</p>
<p>The first-ever Horseshoe Casino opened its gates in 1951. The first WSOP tournament was organized there almost two decades later, in 1970.</p>
<p>The Caesars Entertainment-owned brand is currently responsible for operating and managing 10 different Horseshoe properties spread all across North America.</p>
<p>Caesars announced its intention to purchase Bally’s Las Vegas and turn it into a Horseshoe Casino a year ago, in February 2022.</p>
<p>The property’s general manager and senior vice president Jason Gregorec called the arrival of Horseshoe on The Strip a “significant moment for Caesars Entertainment,” as well as for the Horseshoe brand and the entirety of the city.</p>
<p>Gregorec also expressed excitement for being able to welcome guests to the freshly redesigned resort and its newest additions including the interior and exterior upgrades and renovations and new entertainment and culinary options, while also reintroducing it to Las Vegas.</p>
