<p>PointsBet has signed a partnership deal with LaLiga North America to become the first official betting partner of the joint venture between the multi-national media, sports and entertainment group, Relevent Sports, and the Spanish professional football league, LaLiga.</p>
<p>Sports Betting Partner In The US And Canada</p>
<p>According to the terms of the multi-year agreement, Australian bookmaker PointsBet, through its US subsidiary, PointsBet US, will gain exposure to the expanding audience across North America of the LaLiga football product in terms of marketing campaigns and initiatives to uphold the integrity of the games.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to have been appointed as the first exclusive sportsbook partner of LaLiga in the US commencing ahead of the much anticipated El Gran Derbi later this month”. Johnny Aitken, CEO, PointsBet US</p>
<p>A Joint Venture To Promote Spanish Football</p>
<p>Back in 2018, a joint venture between Relevent Sports, a sports media and entertainment company, and LaLiga, the Spanish professional football league, was established, to promote the top-flight Spanish soccer in US and Canada, granting the joint venture exclusivity in terms of representation for all business and development activities including events, marketing partnerships, youth academies and coaching, for the aforementioned markets. At one point, there was even the idea to bring the LaLiga’s product to North America by having matches from the Spanish professional league take place in the US.</p>
<p>Being one of the few sports betting operators that provide Spanish version of its website, PointsBet was a perfect fit for the Spanish football product of the joint venture, and LaLiga North America’s CEO expressed his excitement from the reached agreement.</p>
<p>“We are excited to grow with PointsBet in the market and enhance the fan experience by bringing LaLiga closer to the fervent audience that exists in the US”. Boris Gartner, CEO, LaLiga North America</p>
<p>Multilingual Addition To LaLiga Content</p>
<p>As part of the multilingual offering, PointsBet will create a “PointsBet Prediction of the Week” segment to be promoted in English and Spanish by LaLiga and Liverpool FC legend Luis Garcia, retired football player Jimmy Conrad and National Womens Soccer League analyst Chelsea Cabarcas. The segment will become part of the LalIga North America content portfolio.</p>
<p>Sports Professional Leagues Hold The Key</p>
<p>Expansion by gaining access to more sports products is part of PointsBet’s strategy and the signed agreement with LaLiga North America is the latest in a series of partnership deals, where the Australian-based sports betting operator became authorized sports betting provider for both NFL and XFL football leagues, as well as for the NBA.</p>
<p>The sports book provider PointsBet started betting operations in New Jersey in 2019 and almost immediately attracted bettors’ attention, as its product Points Betting allowed a bettor to win $600,000 by betting on points difference on a game from Week 1 of 2019 NFL season.</p>
