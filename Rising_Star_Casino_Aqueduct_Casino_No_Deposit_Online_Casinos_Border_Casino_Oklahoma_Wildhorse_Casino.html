<p>Maxence Broville has failed to comply with a demand from the agency and may have committed TACP offenses</p>
<p>The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA), a body seeking to protect tennis from fraud and match manipulation, has confirmed that it has handed a provisional suspension to the French tennis player Maxence Broville. According to the announcement, the ITIA will consider the player’s recent Tennis Anti-Corruption Program (TACP) charges.</p>
<p>The ITIA dated the suspension to June 20, 2023, temporarily prohibiting the athlete from competing in or attending any tennis event sanctioned by tennis governing bodies.</p>
<p>Providing more details about the suspension, the ITIA noted that Maxence Broville has failed to comply with a demand from the agency. In addition, the ITIA pointed out that Broville may have committed a major offense of the TACP.</p>
<p>As outlined in the TACP:</p>
<p>There is a likelihood that the Covered Person has committed a Major Offense and in the absence of a Provisional Suspension, the integrity of tennis would be undermined and the harm resulting from the absence of a Provisional Suspension outweighs the Hardship of the Provisional Suspension on the Covered Person. TACP Section F.3.b.i.4</p>
<p>The ITIA added that Broville has tried to appeal against the imposition of the provisional suspension. However, an unidentified anti-corruption hearing officer rejected the appeal on September 5, 2023, the ITIA noted.</p>
<p>The ITIA Continues to Protect the Tennis Sector from Fraud</p>
<p>The ITIA is an independent body that seeks to protect the integrity of the tennis sector. A month ago, it imposed another sanction on another French player, namely Alexis Musialek. Musialek was banned for life because of serious and repeated violations of the TACP.</p>
<p>According to the ITIA, “the 35-year-old was found to have – among other offenses – contrived the outcome of multiple matches, received money, benefit or consideration for contriving the outcome of these matches.”</p>
<p>In early August, the ITIA banned 3 other players over similar breaches, namely Timur Khabibulin, Sanjar Fayziev and Igor Smilansky. The three conspired together and manipulated matches, committing varying TACP offenses.</p>
<p>A few days earlier, the watchdog also had to suspend Percy Flores, a tennis white badge umpire from Bolivia, who will be unable to participate in sanctioned games for 12 years.</p>
