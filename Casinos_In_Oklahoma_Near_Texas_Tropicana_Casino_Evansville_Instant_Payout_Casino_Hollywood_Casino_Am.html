<p>Powerball, America's favorite lottery game that is available in more than 40 states, continues to grow its jackpot. Most recently, the Powerball jackpot dropped in April this year, and since then it has gone through more than 30 drawings and managed to survive, now surpassing the half-billion-dollar mark for the second time this year. The jackpot survived successfully the drawing on Saturday and Monday, a statement reveals.</p>
<p>The winning numbers from the drawing on Monday, July 3, 2023, 15, 26, 31, 38, 61 and red Powerball 3 saw only one lucky winner secure a $1m dollar prize for guessing correctly all white numbers. Some 13 other lucky Powerball players secured a prize of $50,000, while three of them hit a bigger prize of $150,000 via the game's Power Play option for an additional dollar.</p>
<p>Overall, more than 620,000 players secured prizes that ranged between $4 and $50,000 from Poweball's latest drawing on Monday. Yet, as noted, the grand prize which is estimated at $546m or $282.0m in a cash option, remains to be claimed with hours remaining until the next drawing set for Wednesday, July 5, 2023.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, there were several Powerball jackpots won by lucky players around the US. The first jackpot for 2023 dropped in February when a lucky player from Washington hit a $754.6m prize for guessing all the numbers correctly. Then, in March, a player in Virginia won the jackpot securing $162.6 million from the drawing on March 4, 2023. After that, a winning ticket in Ohio that guessed correctly all white balls and the red Powerball number hit $252.6 million from the drawing on April 19, 2023.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Powerball announced a new partnership with NASCAR. The duo joined forces in February, agreeing to deliver unique and thrilling experiences for Powerball and NASCAR fans alike.</p>
<p>Powerball tickets are sold in 45 states, including the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. Each ticket costs $2, while drawings are broadcasted live on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.</p>
<p>The biggest Powerball jackpot was won last year. Back in November, a lucky player in California secured the staggering $2.04bn jackpot. Although the new Powerball jackpot is far from the $2bn record, the expected $500m or $282m cash value is undoubtedly a life-changing prize for the person or persons that are lucky enough to hit it.</p>
