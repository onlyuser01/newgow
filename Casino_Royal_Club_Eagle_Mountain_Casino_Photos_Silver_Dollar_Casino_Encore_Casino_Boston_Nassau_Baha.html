    <h1>Casino Royal Club Eagle Mountain Casino Photos Silver Dollar Casino Encore Casino Boston Nassau Baha</h1>

<p>Many know Pragmatic Play, and some will also know the game BIG BASS SPLASH. In principle nothing more than BIG Bass Bonanza only with the possibility to get additional functions</p>
<p>Basically runs like this. You got 3 scatters - now the angler is trying to catch fish that swim in a circle and in the middle is the anchor. Every fish he catches comes with additional bonuses to the free spins that come with it. If you're unlucky, he'll catch the anchor right away and you won't get any bonuses, and if he's lucky - he'll catch fish where you can get up to 5 bonuses.</p>
<p>The following bonuses are available.</p>
<p>1) +2 free spins (you always have 12 free spins with each level you reach.</p>
<p>2)More anglers</p>
<p>3) more bombs and hooks</p>
<p>4) advance to level 2 (you start already at level , where all fish have double value)</p>
<p>5) And More Fish</p>
<p>Now, of course, you could say, great, great, amazing!! forget it again</p>
<p>The only 2 bonuses that take place here are +2 free spins more and from level 2 .</p>
<p>All other levels are fooled and do not exist!</p>
<p>I often have bonuses like +more anglers+ or more fish. But I've strangely never seen more than 3 anglers, if ever. It's great if you have more anglers and more fish. It's nice that there are more fish, but every time an angler accidentally got lost, there were never more than 2 fish, strangely enough.</p>
<p>And I'm not just talking about one free spins up to now 95% of all free spins have been like this. So far it's good, I haven't played for some time, just for play money. But that's how it was before that.</p>
<p>And I'm already wondering why bonuses are announced that don't take place. If I feel better every time without bonuses, something is wrong.</p>
<p>It was cool once, I unlocked all 5 bonuses. And in the end I got my first angler with a fish in the last spin. WoW, what bonuses.</p>
<p>The other question - what about roller 4 going on? Have you ever noticed that you usually have to hope for the last reel that the sactter lands here? So why does the 3rd scatter land so rarely?</p>
<p>The better alternative for me back then was Fishin pots of gold, or something like that from Microgaming.</p>
