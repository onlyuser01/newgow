    <h1>Hollywood Casino Aurora Il Mohegan Sun Online Casino Elwha Casino Red Mile Casino Sunset Station Hot</h1>

<p>The company’s entrance into the Peruvian market marks not only a continued trend of expansion in Latin America but also on a global scale. This is the third new market the developer entered this year.</p>
<p>Entry into the Peruvian Market</p>
<p>iGaming developer specialist MGA Games will be supplying more than 200 products with the new contract, enabling NG Gaming to greatly expand its own offerings to Peruvian players. The partnership will cover a wide variety of offerings from video bingo games, through themed slot games to popular table games, such as roulette.</p>
<p>Javier Lanfranchi – director of sales at MGA Games – was cited in multiple outlets, saying that the greatest value the company provides to fans of its games is the sheer variety of the company’s portfolio. This should enable Casino Olimpo.bet to expand its reach, with the partnership itself enabling MGA Games to expand theirs into the region as well.</p>
<p>Peru’s market is currently blossoming, thanks to the recent legalization of online gaming and sports betting last August, so it’s definitely a good opportunity for MGA Games to capitalize on the market’s sustained growth. This means the partnership marks another big step for both sides, and Lanfranchi was cited saying the company was proud of being a part of Peru’s gaming journey.</p>
<p>It’s not only operators and suppliers driving the market, however. With so many new game opportunities opening up to Peruvian players, AstroPay saw the opportunity to launch prepaid Visa cards in the country. The company’s focus on iGaming and betting makes for a perfect synergy and enabled it to offer gaming-oriented solutions.</p>
<p>MGM’s Sustained Expansion</p>
<p>The other LatAm country that the provider set foot in recently was Colombia. MGA Games partnered with Betfair to bring its famous offerings to the operator’s platform in the country. Castle Slots, Golden Throne, Gold Mermaid by Renata Gonzalez, Lucky Dragon, Wild Africa and other titles were already available for players to enjoy on the go.</p>
<p>MGA Games hasn’t neglected other parts of the world with its Latin America expansions, however. On the contrary, the suppliers have been on a roll recently, and it has entered three new European markets since last September when it entered Italy with the Microgame deal. This was followed in November by a new partnership with Videoslots Casino, expanding content into Spain as well.</p>
<p>Towards the tail end of January, we saw neighboring Portugal adding to the list of European countries that MGA Games has set foot on as well. The supplier struck a contract with Caravel and will be catering to the needs of one of its online gambling brands – Moosh. It was also the second new market MGA Games had entered this year, with the Peru expansion being the third. The first one, however, was on an entirely different continent – Africa. MGA Games partnered with Goat Interactive and its Premier Bet gaming brand. The market has often been considered underserved and ripe for major brands to conquer, which is exactly what companies such as 888 Holdings or Betway have already started doing. This, in turn, fuels the need for content, where suppliers come in.</p>
