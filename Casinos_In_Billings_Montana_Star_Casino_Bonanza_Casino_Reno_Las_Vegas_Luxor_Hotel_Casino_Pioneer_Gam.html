<p>The sandwich is inspired by the Milanesa, a dish Messi grew up with</p>
<p>Hard Rock International has unveiled a new partnership with its global brand ambassador, Lionel Messi. According to the announcement, the company will work with the soccer star on a new namesake menu item.</p>
<p>The new item will be a Messi Chicken Sandwich that was “Made For You by Leo Messi.” The dish is inspired by the Milanesa, one of the Argentinean player’s favorite foods.</p>
<p>The new item is described as a “Milanese style” sandwich, with its release coinciding with Messi’s historic entrance into Major League Soccer and his foray into South Florida, which houses the Guitar Hotel at Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Hollywood.</p>
<p>The Milanesa is an Argentinean staple Messi grew up with. Hard Rock’s sandwich version features a crispy Milanese-style chicken breast topped with melted provolone cheese and herbed aioli. The dish also features tomatoes, arugula and a toasted artisan bun. According to Hard Rock, the new item will provide “a winning bite every time.”</p>
<p>The Messi Chicken Sandwich will be available at participating Hard Rock Cafe locations and Hard Rock Hotels &amp; Casinos via in-room dining worldwide starting today.</p>
<p>Hard Rock International celebrated the release of the new item with a new commercial directed by Marco Grandia and the Yes, We’re Open agency. The video is called “Something New is Cooking” and stars Messi. By scanning a unique QR code, fans can hear a welcome message from the soccer star himself and access unique 360 digital experiences, trivia games and more.</p>
<p>Messi Wants to Share the Milanesa with the Rest of the World</p>
<p>Lionel Messi commented on the new collaboration with Hard Rock, sharing his excitement to bring the flavors of Argentina to the rest of the world. He praised Hard Rock International for being the best partner to bring this project to life.</p>
<p>Like any great teammate, Hard Rock has been with me through historic milestones, and I can’t wait for my fans all over the world to get a taste of one of my childhood favorites that still makes me feel at home, wherever in the world I am. Lionel Messi, brand ambassador, Hard Rock International</p>
<p>Jim Allen, Hard Rock International’s chairman, commented on the partnership with the soccer star. He lauded Messi as one of the greatest athletes and a major cultural icon. In addition to that, Allen noted, Messi is a Hard Rock ambassador whose values align with the company’s.</p>
<p>We are extremely honored to partner with someone who embodies the champion and winning spirit in all facets of his professional and personal life, and we look forward to welcoming him to the U.S. as part of our extended Hard Rock family. Jim Allen, chair, Hard Rock International</p>
<p>Previously, Hard Rock and Messi teamed up to release a Messi Burger that has since become a fan favorite. The burger’s launch celebrated Messi’s world championship run and historic win. The release is a part of the company’s “LIVE GREATNESS” campaign.</p>
