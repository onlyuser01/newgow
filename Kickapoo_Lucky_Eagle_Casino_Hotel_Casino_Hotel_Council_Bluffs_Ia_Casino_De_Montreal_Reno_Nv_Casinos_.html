    <h1>Kickapoo Lucky Eagle Casino Hotel Casino Hotel Council Bluffs Ia Casino De Montreal Reno Nv Casinos</h1>

<p>BetGames, a supplier and developer of live dealer and betting games, has launched a new ambitious vertical – Game Shows. The new vertical has immediately found a home with Entain, the leading sports betting and gaming group, with the two companies now exploring this opportunity to further strengthen player engagement and continue to deliver innovative experiences.</p>
<p>Game Shows and Entain’s Focus on Innovation</p>
<p>The companies claim that the new collaboration will enable them to bring “unique live game shows” which will come along with unrivaled experiences. BetGames will execute production and streaming from a state-of-the-art studio fully tailored for the needs of the vertical and audiences.</p>
<p>There will be three bespoke gaming shows to get the ball rolling at first. The first one is Starzle. The title is a number-themed gameshow and is immediately available to Entain. The partnership between the companies will allow for immediate integration with Ladbrokes, which is the target of these first forays into the game shows vertically.</p>
<p>There will be both number-themed mechanics but also card-based elements, the companies added in an official press release. Both are confident that the new game is sure to have a broad appeal and strike home with audiences.</p>
<p>The launch at Ladbrokes may be followed by similar Game Shows integration across a number of brands. As a reminder, Entain currently owns some of the top-performing iGaming brands in the United Kingdom and beyond, to name Coral, Foxy Bingo, PartyCaisno, bwin, Gala, and many others.</p>
<p>Entain sees in this launch the latest events that are aligned with the company’s mission statement to continue innovating on the iGaming experience by setting new trends. The ambitious project is also a first for BetGames which has worked hard to create brand-new products to be directly launched with Entain’s trusted and prominent brands, giving the supplier and developer an immediate visibility boost.</p>
<p>BetGames Happy with This Development</p>
<p>BetGames CEO Andreas Koeberl commented on this opportunity and said that the company was pleased to be teaming up with the world’s largest gaming organization and innovation leader. He added:</p>
<p>This is a game changer for us as a company and a result of our successful transformation over the previous 18 months. The fantastic collaboration with Entain’s brilliant product, brand, and commercial teams enabled us to launch the game – from ideation to production – within only nine months. BetGames CEO Andreas Koeberl</p>
<p>Koeberl confirmed that the new Game Shows product is carefully curated and it will offer the best possible gambling experience. The company feels enthusiastic about its chance of realizing a strong new vertical that will bring benefits to customers and businesses.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new release, Entain head of live casino Graciella Anthony said that Starzle will be available as a long-term exclusive title for Entain. Entain’s live casino commercial &amp; product manager, Adam Lahouiri, added that the implementation of the Game Show product has been an important and exciting project to be a part of. The true success of BetGames’ new product will be measured by player reception.</p>
