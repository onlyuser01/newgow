<p>Hello Kristina,</p>
<p>Thank you for your feedback. According to my legal opinion, companies that offer their services in EU countries and in particular are registered in the EU, as 1XBet is, must send the copy of the GDPR / DPO. Here it does not matter whether it is a casino or another company.</p>
<p>As far as I can remember, my account was opened in 2016 (?) and was active for several years. I haven't played with the provider since 2019 or 2020.</p>
<p>I am sending you an email with all the correspondence where 1xBet refuses to comply with my request.</p>
<p>The message I send was :</p>
<hr />
<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

<p>from you, free of charge, information on the following personal data concerning from me,</p>

<ol>
<li>Time (day/month/year) and amount of each ingoing payment into the user account</li>
</ol>
<p>since registration.</p>
<ol>
<li>Time (day/month/year) and amount of each outgoing payment from the user</li>
</ol>
<p>account since registration.</p>
<ol>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>

<p>You are welcome to reply to this request for information via this e-mail address.</p>
<p>We set you a deadline of one month to provide this information, ie up to</p>
<p>September 14, 2022 (date of reception).</p>
<p>Should you fail to provide the information until this date, I may take further action.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
