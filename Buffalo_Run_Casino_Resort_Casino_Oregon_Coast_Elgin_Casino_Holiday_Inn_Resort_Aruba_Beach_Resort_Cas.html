    <h1>Buffalo Run Casino Resort Casino Oregon Coast Elgin Casino Holiday Inn Resort Aruba Beach Resort Cas</h1>

<p>I create an account some days ago, i create for streamer influence, i have some account from different casinos, i dont believe them,i did not get my withdraw from different casinos so i afraid for deposit, Coinslotty is one them, i deposit only for stemers infuance, this casino have 3x wager rule, So i deposit and finish my wager, after that i do my verification process it take 20-30 mins, after submit i talk to support they approved my kyc documents, then i submit withdraw my money, before i withdraw i talk to the stemers about withdraw time &amp; kyc, he said that it take upto 24 hours, 24 hours is long time, but i am prepared for that.after 28 hours i did not recived my withdraw then i talk to there support different time, no one cant said how much takes time, i totally fed-up with there answers, after 28 hours to 32 hours i talk with them 5 times,but no solution,everytime same talk by different support member,then i try to talk the stemers,in the time i cant login my account, i got a mail form there support team,' my account is disable to login' i violent there term and conditions, but when i talk again with support team they cant tell what was the term and conditions that i violed, they mailed me they gonna send me my deposit money, asking for my crypto details,now when i write the post its almost 72 hours already gone just before i write the post i was talked with there support team again they cant give me solution and same talk "We transferred your refund request to our finance department, the refund will be processed as soon as possible, you will receive an email notification"</p>
<p>I dont know will i get my money or not, but please everyone be safe from the scam casinos,if your money is your own &amp; you do it for hard working, please never deposit at "coin slotty " you can win hear, but cant withdraw from there.this post is only for your conscious.</p>
