    <h1>Casino Near Me With Hotel Casino Palm Springs Cast Of Movie Casino Free Casino Bonus Jackpot City Ca</h1>

<p>Sports Information Services, a specialist that delivers live betting services round-the-clock, has made a new foray into the US market</p>
<p>The company has launched its dedicated esports Competitive Gaming product in Colorado, a second jurisdiction in the United States so far.</p>
<p>SIS Expands Esports Betting Reach in the US with Colorado</p>
<p>The solution is brought forward with a local and long-term partner bet365 which will leverage it to provide players with an even better variety of esports matches and gaming products to choose from. The SIS esports solution will begin by introducing eBasketball first.</p>
<p>SIS has developed H2H Global Gaming League to provide more than 180,000 events per year and the company’s product is an end-to-end solution that makes for easy integration and maintenance. As SIS puts it, its product drives and delivers on “superior margins” referring to the quality of the betting markets.</p>
<p>The product itself is extremely lightweight making for smooth operation from start to finish. Referees who oversee the games are all trained by ESIC, an industry watchdog that maintains the integrity of esports competitions. Put all of this together and there are excellent opportunities for sports bettors to enjoy innovative betting markets.</p>
<p>The events and games that are offered by SIS’s H2H Global Gaming League are in fact streamed from the United Kingdom in self-contained gaming studios built purposefully for this. SIS Content Services president and chief executive Richard Ames had this to say:</p>
<p>Having a second US launch so soon after the first is a testament to the rapid progress we are making in the North American market and showcases our ability to provide bettors with engaging content as well as further enhance our relationship with our valued long-term partner bet365. SIS Content Services president and chief executive Richard Ames</p>
<p>The partnership comes after SIS was able to introduce its competitive product in New Jersey previously. SIS Content Services VP Michele Fischer was equally pleased with the idea of bringing more relevant esports opportunities to the market in Colorado.</p>
<p>Fischer added that she expects customers to react positively to the esports basketball content brought around by SIS. “This deal is further evidence of the footprint SIS is making in what will continue to be a rapidly growing and key market for the company,” Fisher concluded.</p>
<p>SIS and bet365 previously worked on a new lottery game, Lotto365, built and branded for the purposes of raising awareness for the operator’s brand and name.</p>
