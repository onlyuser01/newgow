    <h1>Casino Drive Winstar Casino Phone Number Casinos New Jersey Hertel Casino Double Down Casino Free Ch</h1>

<p>Dear Art84,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for submitting your complaint. I’m very sorry to hear about your negative experience. First, I would like to emphasize that our forum Casino.guru, deals with complaints regarding online casinos only. I understand it must be difficult for you, but unfortunately, we don’t have enough insight to take on this kind of issue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some casinos require to wager real money deposit. This is one of the standard AML (anti-money laundering) rules. Not all casinos require this, but it isn't anything unfair. I have also checked the casino’s withdrawal rules in T&amp;Cs and I found this:</p>
<p>„3.14. A customer can withdraw money from his account only after he has rolled each of his deposits at least 5 times. Wagers with odds lower than 1.6 (sports and virtual sports betting) or casino wagers with minimum/no risk are not counted towards the rollover. If the player doesn’t meet this requirement, Hot.bet reserves the right to reject the withdrawal or apply an administrative fee of up to 8%. All Running, Cash-out bets, Tie (Draw), Cancelled, Refunded and Denied bets, or bets placed on multiple outcomes of the same event are not considered towards the calculation of the turnover."</p>
<p>I suggest you fulfilling the requirements, otherwise, you won’t be able to request the withdrawal.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kristina</p>
