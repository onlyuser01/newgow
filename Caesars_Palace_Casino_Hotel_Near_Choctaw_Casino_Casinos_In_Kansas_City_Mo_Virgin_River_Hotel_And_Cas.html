<p>Wild Hike review</p>
<p>Theme and Storyline</p>
<p>Wild Hike invites players into a mysterious forest where a variety of wild animals await.</p>
<p>Players will warm their hands by a campfire and then set into the night to explore the wilderness. As they meet owls, wolves, and deer, they might discover some of nature’s magical secrets.</p>
<p>Graphics, Sounds and Animations</p>
<p>Wild Hike’s soundtrack is a gentle melody blended with the calls of birds, the snorts of boar’s, and the crackling of a fire. This helps create the outdoor setting and reminds players that wildlife is nearby.</p>
<p>Among the symbols players will find a range of forest-dwelling animals, including great horned owls, tusked boars, bears, and deer. Each creature is illustrated in a realistic style with light catching their fur or feathers, giving them an ethereal look.</p>
<p>The reels themselves are crafted from mossy branches, ensuring they blend in with the environment. In the background, a dark forest can be seen with a glowing campfire creating just enough light to make out the shapes of trees and branches.</p>
<p>The soundtrack and animation of this slot create a dreamy natural world.</p>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<p>Wild Hike is a six-reel, four-row slot.</p>
<p>Wins are awarded for landing at least three matching symbols in adjacent reels, starting from the leftmost reel. This is sometimes called an Any Way Wins system.</p>
<p>Only the longest winning combination on a given spin will be paid.</p>
<p>In total, there are 4,096 ways to win, and the maximum possible win is 20,000x the player’s total bet.</p>

<p>Wilds, Bonuses and Free Spins</p>
<p>The Wild symbol substitutes for all regular symbols. Whenever Wild symbols land on reels 2, 3, 4, or 5, they will expand to cover the entire reel, replacing any symbols on that reel.</p>
<p>The Free Spins feature begins when players land 3-4 Free Spin symbols. If 3 Free Spin symbols trigger the feature, 7 free spins are awarded. Meanwhile, 4 triggering Free Spin symbols award 10 free spins.</p>
<p>During the Free Spins feature, any acquired multipliers on Expanding Wilds will remain in place.</p>
<p>Should players land Free Spin symbols during the Free Spins feature, they will be awarded an additional free spin for every symbol.</p>
<p>Players may buy directly into the Free Spins feature if they wish. For an additional fee, players will be guaranteed a win on double Expanding Wilds.</p>
