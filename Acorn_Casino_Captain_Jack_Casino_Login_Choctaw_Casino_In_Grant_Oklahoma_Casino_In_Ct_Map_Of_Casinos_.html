<p>R. Franco Digital, the digital arm of the namesake R. Franco Group, has announced a new partnership that is positioning the company firmly in the iGaming landscape and radar. The supplier is bringing its full range of games to Betsson Group, a trusted and global partner with a huge reach across global markets.</p>
<p>R. Franco Digital has a library of games certified under a Malta Gaming Authority license, which will now be available to Betsson Group and builds upon the supplier’s long-term commitment towards the European market, and its biggest brands.</p>
<p>Through this new collaboration, Betsson Group will gain access to a range of R Franco Digital games, which include Cyborg 30L, Vacuum Buster, and Witches South among other prominent releases by the company.</p>
<p>R. Franco Digital online sales director Mario Benito welcomed the opportunity to team up with Betsson and hailed it as a "further testament" that the supplier had a robust growth strategy that allowed it to team up with some of the most historied entities in the iGaming industry.</p>
<p>"We are confident that our slot content will continue to impress operators from around the world and that this will mark another successful collaboration," Benito explained.</p>
<p>The two companies have agreed to include present and future releases as part of the offer, with the studio ready to add more slot games to Betsson Group’s library over the coming months. The news was welcomed equally well by Sarah Micallef, the Head of Gaming Operations for Betsson Group, who said her company was delighted to integrate what she described as a world-class portfolio of games.</p>
<p>R. Franco Digital makes for a very strong and trusted partner, Micallef said. This latest addition to Betsson’s own collection would give the group a significant boost to its iGaming reach. R. Franco Digital, which operates out of Spain, is one of the country’s favorite suppliers, but it has also achieved international fame by teaming up with some of the biggest gambling companies in Europe and beyond.</p>
<p>Betsson has been steadily growing its footprint in multiple markets in the meantime. The company has not limited itself to just the iGaming landscape, driving forays into the sports sector as well. Betsson recently announced its support for Peruvian topflight football.</p>
